            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For howſoeuer the light of the Goſpell hath for manie yeeres clearelie ſhined among vs, ſhewing vnto vs the way of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, in which we walking may attaine vnto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, and the manifold by-paths of error and ſinne, to the end we may auoid them; and though we haue had Gods faithfull Miniſters, ſometimes piping vnto vs the ſweete tunes of the Goſpell, to allure vs vnto holie obedience; and ſometimes thundring out the dreadfull ſound of Gods fearefull iudgements due to
<pb facs="tcp:10736:3"/>ſinne, to reſtraine vs from running on in wicked courſes; yet there is little reformation and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but rather we are growne from ill to worſe, and waxe euerie day more ſecure and ſenſuall in our ſins. And becauſe men haue not imbraced and loued Gods truth, nor ſubmitted themſelues to bee ruled with this ſcepter of his kingdome; therfore many are giuen vp of God to their own filthie luſts, and to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate minde, and through the hardneſſe of their hearts, all the meanes of their conuerſion and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on become not only vneffectuall and vnprofitable, but rather cauſe them to bee more obdurate in their ſinnes. The reſplendent light of the Goſpell doth make them more blind, ſo as they goe groping in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance euen at noone daies; the ſound of the word, and loud cries of Gods Miniſters in their eares calling them to repentance, doe make them more deafe to all inſtruction and admonition; the comfortable beames of Gods gracious promiſes ſhining vpon their hearts, doe not ſupple and ſoften them, but rather make them more hard and obdurate; and as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 2.16.</note> the word of God, which in it own nature is the ſauor of life vnto life, becommeth vnto them the ſauour of death to their deeper condemnation. And as this is the ſtate of all the who haue ſold themſelues to worke wickedneſſe, and lie frozen in the dregs of their ſinnes; ſo euen the better ſort who haue giuen their names vnto Chriſt, haue been ſo intoxicated with the ſweete cups of proſperitie, and through long reſt, peace, and plentie haue ſo ruſted in their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it is to be feared, they will not recouer their ancient puritie and brightneſſe, vntill the file of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction with an heauie hand hath come often ouer
<pb facs="tcp:10736:3"/>them. But neither the crying ſinnes of thoſe who are notoriouſlie wicked, nor yet the groſſe corruptions of ſuch as make profeſſion of religion, doe cauſe the ſtate of our land to bee ſo dangerous and almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, as the nice wantonneſſe of ſinne, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it impatient of the leaſt touch; for howſoeuer it is in it ſelfe of the moſt ſlauiſh nature, yet is it ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in theſe times with the numerous multitude of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and ſo countenanced and befriended by men of beſt qualitie, and greateſt power, that it is growne to be a matter farre more dangerous to reprooue ſin then to commit it, eſpeciallie when it is cunninglie acted, and plainelie reprehended. Gods ſpirituall Chirurgions may indeede in theſe times make as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie corraſiues as they will, but if they loue their peace and life, they muſt take heed that they doe not apply them; for patients wounded with the ſores of ſinne, when they admit them to the cure, hold the dagger of reuenge in their hands, readie to ſtab them, if they but touch them to the quicke. And therefore needs muſt theſe impatient patients feſter in their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the verie death of bodie and ſoule, ſeeing they will by no meanes indure to haue their wounds ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. Neuertheleſſe all this muſt not daunt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe whom the Lord hath called to the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Miniſterie, from the performing of their dutie, but the more dangerous and deſperate their ſtate is who are committed to their charge, the more earneſt and diligent ſhould they ſhew themſelues in ſeeking their preſeruation. For they ought to preferre the ſpirituall health of thoſe who are by God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their cure, before their owne temporarie life; and being appointed the Lords watchmen, the
<pb facs="tcp:10736:4"/>more ſecurely the people ſleepe in ſinne, the louder muſt they crie till they haue awakened them, when they ſee Gods iudgements approching and readie to ſeaze vpon them:<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.7.8.</note> otherwiſe the people ſhall die in their ſinnes, but their blood ſhall be required at the watchmens hands. The conſideration of which du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and the intire loue which I beare to my deare countrie, hath made me willing, whom the Lord hath vouchſafed this great and excellent calling, to beate down, as much as in me lieth, foure capitall ſins of this land, prophane Swearing, beaſtly Dru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kennes, filthie Whordome, and corrupting Bribery; both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſo odious and abominable in Gods ſight, that they make our whole countrie liable to his wrath, and to ſtand indangered to the fearefulleſt of his iudgements; and alſo becauſe I perceiue that they are not in the wane, but in the increaſe; and that like fretting cankers, they ſpread further and further in the body of our State; ſo that if thoſe members which are alreadie infected bee not either cured by Gods Miniſters, or cut off by his lawfull Magiſtrates, it is to be feared that theſe ſores of ſinne will grow deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and paſt hope of any cure. The which my poore labours I deſired ſhould offer themſelues vnto the publicke view vnder the ſafe-guard of you honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patronage, being mooued thereunto both by mine owne loue, and your fitneſſe: my loue towards your Honours, being chiefely grounded vpon your loue towards God, and to his true religion, ſhewed both in your holy profeſſion and Chriſtian practiſe, hath imboldned me to leaue vnto the world this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall teſtimonie of your worth, and my good-will; and maketh me beleeue, that theſe my workes ſhrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb facs="tcp:10736:4"/>vnder your names ſhal find with you kind accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, not vpon preſumption of their worth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is the nature of loue to cauſe a man hopefully to expect for correſpondencie of affection in them whom it loueth, though there be almoſt no proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in deſert. Neither could I find fitter patrons for treatiſes of this nature; for who are more fit then the vertues and religious to defend and countenance ſuch diſcourſes as tend to the vpholding and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of vertue and pietie, and to the ſuppreſſing and beating down of vice and wickedneſſe? and who are more able to daunt the courages of the vicious and malicious, which are daily ready to wreck their ſpight vpon thoſe who inueigh againſt their darling ſinnes, then they, whoſe vertuous diſpoſition is both graced and ſtrengthened with honour and eminencie of place, and alſo with the gracious fauour of our dread Soueraigne? As therefore I haue reſpectiuelie dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated theſe my labours vnto your Honours, ſo accept them with your wonted kindneſſe, and vouchſafe them at your leaſured your peruſall, and me your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable fauours; ſo ſhall I bee more and more bound to pray vnto the Lord, that he will grant vnto your Honors a daily increaſe of grace and true honor in this world, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glorie and happines in the world to come.</p>

If any notwithstanding my iust apologie ſhall yet take exceptions, they ſhall but by their kicking ſhew that I rub on their ſore, and by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning manifeſt their guiltineſſe; for in particular I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe none, who doe not ſtand accuſed before God, by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie of their owne conſciences. And theſe of all others haue least cauſe to be offended, ſeeing if at all I handle them roughly, it is not to hurt, but to cure them of their wounds of ſinne, which otherwiſe might feſter to their destruction. And thus praying that theſe and all other my labours may tend to Gods glorie, and the ſaluation of his elect, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend thee to Gods protection,<note place="margin">Act. 20.32.</note> and <hi>vnto the word of his grace, which is able to build thee further, and to giue thee an inheritance among them which are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>

                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:10736:7"/>
                     <p>And firſt to begin with the generall definition:<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> VVhat an oath is.</note> 
                        <hi>An oath is a religious and ſolemne atteſtation of Gods holy name, where we inuocate him as a witneſſe and ſuertie to confirme the truth of our ſpeech, and as a Iudge to puniſh vs if we ſpeake falſely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Of this there are diuers formes, and diuers ceremonies. In reſpect of the diuers forme, an oath is either ſimple and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, or compound and indirect. Simple, when as we plainly and directly call God to witneſſe. So the Apoſtle, Rom. 1.9. <hi>God is my witneſſe whom I ſerue in my ſpirit,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.9.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Compound, when as there is prayer or pawne annexed. The prayer annexed to an oath is either the deſire of ſome good; as, <hi>So God helpe, ſaue, or prosper me:</hi> or the imprecation of ſome euill if we ſweare falſely, as, <hi>God doe ſo, or ſo vnto me,</hi> if I doe not ſpeake the truth. So alſo in our oathes we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pawne and pledge vnto God thoſe things which are deere vnto vs, as it were ſuerties of our truth; as, <hi>By my ſoule, by my faith,</hi> &amp;c. that is, I pawne my ſoule and faith vnto God, for the confirmation of this truth. So <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſwore by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 42.15. 1. Cor. 15.31. §. <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. <hi>Ceremonies and rites vſed in ſwearing.</hi> Gen. 14.22.</note> Gen. 42.15. and <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.31. <hi>By our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing which I haue in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, I die daily.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ceremonies vſed in ſwearing haue bin diuers in diuers times. In <hi>Abrahams</hi> time when they took an oath they lifted vp their hand towards heauen; thereby ſignifying that they ſwore by him whoſe throne was ſeated in the higheſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens. The like ceremonie was vſed by the Angell, Dan. 12.7. So alſo inferiours in the ſame time ſwearing vnto their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours and Maſters,<note place="margin">Aben. Ezra.</note> put their hand vnder their thigh, by which ceremonie, they ſignified their ſubiection, and that they bound themſelues to perpetuall ſeruitude if they did not ſpeake truly.<note place="margin">Gen. 24.2. and 47.29.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Salomons</hi> time when as they took an oath they touched the Altar,<note place="margin">1. King. 2.31.</note> the which ceremonie was alſo vſed amongſt the Gentiles; whereby was ſignified that they did call him to witneſſe who was worſhipped with ſacrifices offered vpon thoſe Altars.</p>
                     <p>The Iewes when they ſolemnely ſwore by Gods holie name, vſed to touch the Bible, the which ceremonie is alſo in vſe in theſe times; whereby is ſignified that they call him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10736:7"/>as witneſſe, who is the author of theſe holie Scriptures; and that as the contents of this holie booke are of vndoubted and certaine truth, ſo that which they deliuer is of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and free from all vntruth and falſehood.</p>
                     <p>And thus haue I briefly ſhewed what an oath is,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> The ends of an oath.</note> together with the formes and ceremonies thereof. Now the ends why it was inſtituted and ordained, were firſt and principally that God might be glorified, when as by an oath hee is appealed vnto as the ſupreme Iudge of heauen and earth, and his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience, truth, iuſtice and power is acknowledged. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that truth and iuſtice might be maintained and preſerued in things ſecret and vnkowne: for when all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and reaſons are wanting to demonſtrate a waightie and neceſſarie truth, then God, who is the ſearcher of the heart and reines, the patrone of truth and reuenger of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, is inuocated as a witneſſe aboue all exceptions. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, an oath was ordained to maintaine truth, peace, concord and iuſtice, and to put an end to al doubts and controuerſies, as the Apoſtle ſheweth,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> Heb. 6.16. For wee can haue no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appeale when as the matter hath been decided before the ſupreme Iudge of heauen and earth; neither can we bring any ſtronger argument for proofe, then when wee produce God as our witneſſe to giue teſtimonie to our ſpeeches, who is the alone ſearcher of the heart and ſecret thoughts. And therefore an oath is fitly called the greateſt proofe amongſt men to confirme their ſpeeches,<note place="margin">Plutarch. Rom. quaeſt.</note> and the Chriſtians racke, whereby though he be the Lords freeman, he may neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe be inforced to confeſſe any hidden truth. And laſtly, for the common good of mankind, both of our neighbours, and alſo our ſelues: for our neighbours haue good and benefit by our oathes, when as therby they are perſwaded to beleeue a neceſſarie truth, or when their right is defended, and their good name preſerued from ſlanders and falſe imputations; in which reſpect alſo the benefit of our oath redoundeth to our ſelues, when either our owne name or right is called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, wee wanting other reaſons and meanes to maintaine them againſt iniurie and iniuſtice.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> That it is lawfull to take an oath, contrarie to the doctrine of the Manichees and Anabaptiſts.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Euertheleſſe,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> That all maner of ſwearing is not condemned</note> howſoeur a lawfull oath is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, and a part of his glorie, and to the furthering of our owne and our neighbors good, yet the Manichees of old, and the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts of latter daies, haue ſimply condemned all manner of ſwearing both publike and priuate, as euill and vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But that this their opinion is falſe, hereticall and wicked, it may euidently appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, becauſe a lawfull oath is a part of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, which is expreſly commanded in his word. For whereas in the third Commandement he forbiddeth to take his name in vaine by vſuall or falſe ſwearing, there in the affirmatiue part he inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that wee ſhould vſe the holie name of God in a lawfull oath, for the ſetting foorth of his glorie: and thus this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is expounded by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. So Deut. 6.13.<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13. and 10.20. Eſa. 65.16.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerue him, and ſhalt ſweare by his name.</hi> And Deut. 10.20. Eſa. 65.16. <hi>He that ſhall bleſſe in the earth, ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in the true God, and hee that ſweareth in the earth ſhall ſweare by the true God.</hi> Iere. 4.2.<note place="margin">Ierem. 4.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt ſweare the Lord liueth, in truth, in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea ſo excellent and neceſſarie a part of Gods ſeruice is a lawfull oath, that ſometimes it is put for his whole worſhip. Pſal. 63.11.<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.11.</note> 
                        <hi>All that ſweare by him ſhall reioyce before him,</hi> that is, all that worſhip and ſerue him. So Eſa. 19.18. it is ſaid that the Egyptians ſhall <hi>ſpeake the language of Canaan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſa. 19.18. and 48.1.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſhall ſweare by the Lord of hoſtes;</hi> that is, ſhall make profeſſion of his true religion. And chap. 48.1. <hi>Heare this O houſe of Iacob, which ſweare by the name of the Lord:</hi> that is, profeſſe the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the true God.</p>
                     <p>So that a lawfull oath is ſingular part of his worſhip,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi>

                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10736:8"/>which,<note place="margin">A lawfull oath is a part of Gods worſhip.</note> as occaſion ſerueth, hee will not haue omitted: and therefore he not only commandeth it, but alſo hath ſworne, that thoſe who worſhip him ſhall ſweare by his name: Eſa. 45.23.<note place="margin">Eſa. 45.23.</note> 
                        <hi>I haue ſworne by my ſelfe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that euery knee ſhall bow vnto me, and euery tongue ſhall ſweare by me.</hi> Which dutie that they may bee incouraged to performe, hee hath promiſed to reward it in this life:<note place="margin">Iere. 12.16.</note> Ierem. 12.16. <hi>If they will learne the waies of my people, to ſweare by my name, the Lord liueth</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then ſhall they be built in the middeſt of my people:</hi> and in the life to come with eternall happineſſe: for he that ſweareth and changeth not, though it be to his owne hindrance, hee ſhall dwell in Gods holie mountaine.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pſal. 15.4.</hi> §. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> By a lawfull oath God is glorified.</note> Pſal. 15.4.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a lawfull oath is commendable, becauſe it ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the aduancement of Gods glorie, and the good of mankinde. God in a lawfull oath is glorified: firſt, becauſe therein we acknowledge his omnipreſence; for in vaine doe we call God to witneſſe, vnleſſe he were preſent euery where and readie to heare vs.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, his omniſcience: for when we call God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſecret actions, thoughts and intentions, which can by no other meanes be demonſtrated, we acknowledge that hee is of infinite knowledge,<note place="margin">Iob 42.2. Pſal. 139.2. Ierem. 17.10. Heb. 4.13.</note> and that nothing is hid from him, that he is the ſearcher of the heart and reines, and that all things lie naked in his view.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, his truth is acknowledged when as men appeale vnto him as vnto a witneſſe who cannot deceiue nor be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and who ſpeaking the truth himſelfe doth alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it in others, and puniſh the contrarie falſehood.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, his iuſtice and power is in a lawfull oath confeſſed and acknowledged, when as wee appeale vnto him as a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of infallible truth, and vnpartiall iuſtice, who will giue a iuſt teſtimonie without reſpect of perſons; and as vnto an vpright and moſt powerfull Iudge who is able to patronize and reward truth, and to puniſh falſehood and vntruth.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is profitable for men, becauſe it is the chiefe confirmation of our aſſurance in any truth,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> A lawfull oath is profitable for men.</note> and more to bee credited and reſpected, then the moſt manifeſt arguments and trueſt witneſſes that can be produced: and therefore the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10736:9"/>Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> that <hi>an oath for confirmation is the end of all ſtrife,</hi> Heb. 6.16. And conſequently great is the profit which is bringeth no mankinde, ſeeing it is a notable meanes, not only for the maintaining of truth and iuſtice, but alſo for the taking away of diſcord and diſſenſions, and for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of peace and Chriſtian friendſhip.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> The vſe of a lawfull oath vvarranted by examples.</note> the vſe of a lawfull oath is not only warranted, but alſo commended vnto vs by manifold examples in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As firſt, the Saints and holie men of God, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of neceſſarie and vndemonſtrable truths, and to put an end to controuerſies and diſſenſions, haue vſed to ſweare one to another: As <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> to <hi>Abimilech, Iacob</hi> to <hi>Laban, Ioſeph</hi> to <hi>Iacob, Dauid</hi> to <hi>Ionathan, Elias</hi> to <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and many other. And leſt it ſhould bee obiected, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they were holy Saints of God, yet they were men, and might therefore erre; we are further to know, that the holie men of God as they were the penmen of holie Scripture, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly inſpired by the holie Ghoſt, and conſequently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all error and ſinne, did in the penning of the Scriptures confirme the truth of God by a lawfull and pious oath. Examples hereof are manifold: Rom. 1.9. <hi>God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 1.9. and 9.1.</note> 
                        <hi>whom I ſerue in my ſpirit.</hi> And 9.1. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lie not my conſcience bearing me witneſſe in the holy Ghoſt.</hi> The like paces wee haue, 1. Cor. 15.31.2. Cor. 1.23. and 11.31. and 12.19. Gal. 1.10. Phil. 1.8.1. Theſ. 2.5.10.2. Theſ. 2.1.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe the holy Angels, who are priuiledged from ſin and error, haue vſed the name of their great Lord and Maſter in ſwearing by it.<note place="margin">Dan. 12.7.</note> Dan. 12.7. it is ſaid that the Angell <hi>held vp his right hand and his left hand vnto heauen, and ſware by him that liueth for euer.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 10.5.6.</note> So Apoc. 10.5.6. But what ſhould I ſtand vpon the example of the creatures, when as the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of heauen and earth hath approoued the holie vſe of an oath in his owne practiſe?<note place="margin">Gen. 22.16.</note> Geneſ. 22.16. <hi>By my ſelfe haue I ſworne (ſaith the Lord) becauſe thou haſt done this thing,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>As I liue (ſaith the Lord) I will ſurely doe vnto you euen as ye haue ſpoken in mine eares.</hi> So Pſal. 110.4. and 132. 11. Eſa. 14.24. and 45.23. and 54.9. Iere. 44.26. Luk. 1.73. Rom. 14.11. Heb. 6.13.16.</p>

                     <p>Againſt this the Anabaptiſts obiect the ſaying of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6.</hi> An obiection out of <hi>Math. 5.34.</hi> anſwered.</note> Mat.chap.5. verſ.34. <hi>But I ſay vnto you, ſweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God,</hi> &amp;c. Whence they gather, that howſoeuer ſwearing was vſed and allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, yet no manner of oathes are lawfull in the time of the Goſpell. To which I anſwere, that their interpretation of theſe words is both wicked and abſurd: firſt, becauſe they hereby make this Scripture contradict other places which directly inioyne a lawfull oath. Secondly, hereby they make Chriſt condemne the practiſe of his holy Saints, and euen of the penmen of the holy Scriptures, yea of God the Father himſelfe, as before hath bin ſhewed. Yea they make Chriſts precept contrarie to his owne practiſe, for he himſelf vpon waightie occaſion vſed that earneſt and ſolemne aſſeuera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Amen, Amen; Verely, verely:</hi> which though it ſhould be no oath,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.14.</note> as the Apoſtle ſeemeth to implie that it is, Heb. 6.14. yet is it at leaſt a vehement aſſeueration, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more then, <hi>yea, yea, and nay, nay.</hi> And moreouer, they make our Sauiour to contradict his owne words, verſe 17. where he ſaith, that he <hi>came not to deſtroy the Law or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but to fulfill them:</hi> for if he ſhould take away the vſe of a lawfull oath, hee ſhould deſtroy part of the Morall law, which inioyneth it as a part of Gods ſeruice, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhould ſpoile God his Father of a part of his worſhippe, which was not only required vnder the Law, but alſo it was foretold that the Church of Chriſt ſhould alſo vſe it in the time of the Goſpell:<note place="margin">Eſa. 19.18. and 65.16.</note> Eſa. 19.18. and 65.16. Thirdly, hereby they ouerthrow the law of nature and nations, which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed a lawfull oath in waightie and neceſſary cauſes euen before the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as appeareth in the ſtorie of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs. Laſtly, they hereby weaken truth, by plucking from it the chiefe band whereby it is ſtrengthened and confirmed; they take away the meanes to end controuerſies, and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with it peace, amitie, and agreement, and ſo leaue a wide doore open to iealouſie, ſuſpition, diſcord and diſſenſion.</p>
                     <p>This interpretation therefore is not to be receiued,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>7. Math. 5.34</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</note> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther another which admitteth none of the former abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10736:10"/>and better agreeth with the maine drift and ſcope of Chriſt in this place. Now the drift of Chriſt was not to take away the vſe of an oath, and ſo to diſanull a part of the law, againſt which in the beginning of his ſpeech he proteſted, but to vindicate and free it from the corrupt gloſſes and falſe expoſitions of the Phariſies; who tooke away the ſpirituall vnderſtanding which is the chiefe life of law, and expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Commandements (like the Papiſts in theſe daies) in a litterall and groſſe ſenſe onely, namely, of the outward fact alone in the groſſeſt kinde. For example, that the ſixth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement onely forbiddeth actuall killing; the ſeuenth, actuall vncleanneſſe; and the third, periurie and falſe ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring by the name of God. For howſoeuer they had the name of God himſelfe in ſome outward reuerence, yet they taught that it was lawfull to ſweare in their ordinarie communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the creatures, which did not immediatly appertaine to Gods worſhip and ſeruice, as the heauens, the earth, the altar, their head and ſuch like; becauſe the Commandement onely forbiddeth to take the name of the Lord our God in vaine. And ſecondly, they taught that if a man had ſworne by theſe creatures, and did not keepe his oath, yet hee ſinned not,<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.12.</note> becauſe it is ſaid, Leuit. 19.12. <hi>Yee ſhall not ſweare by my name falſely, neither ſhalt thou defile the name of thy God.</hi> And this appeareth both in the 5.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.23.</note> and 23. Chapters of Mat. where Chriſt laboureth to confute this falſe doctrine, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme theſe abuſes. In the fifth Chapter, and verſe 33. he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth their doctrine; <hi>Yee haue heard that it was ſaid to them of old time, Thou ſhalt not forſweare thy ſelfe, but ſhalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme thine oathes to the Lord: but I ſay vnto you, Sweare not at all, neither by heauen, for it is the throne of God,</hi> &amp;c. Where hee ſheweth that they had in their doctrine condemned for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing, and not vaine ſwearing, and this falſe ſwearing by the name of God alone, and not by the creatures. So in the 23.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.16.17.</note> Chapter, verſe 16.17.18. they taught that they might ſweare by the Temple, by the Altar, and by their head, and that all this was nothing, neither in regard of their vaine ſwearing, nor yet forſwearing by theſe creatures. Now our
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10736:10"/>Sauiour laboureth to free the pure law of God from theſe ſpots of their falſe interpretations, and ſheweth, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hee who had ſlaine a man was a murtherer, but hee who had been vniuſtly angrie with him in his heart, and had reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him with his tongue; that he alſo was an adulterer before God, who in his heart had luſted after a woman, as well as he who had lien with her.</p>
                     <p>So likewiſe hee refuteth their falſe doctrine concerning oathes, and ſheweth that we muſt not in our ordinarie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication ſweare at all, no not by the creatures, becauſe in theſe oathes the name of God is obliquely and indirectly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vaine, there remaining in them ſome prints and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of Gods power and Maieſtie: for they who ſweare by heauen, ſweare indirectly by God, becauſe heauen is his throne; ſo they what ſweare by the earth, ſweare alſo by him, becauſe it is his footſtoole; and in like manner the Temple and Altar belong to his worſhip, and our heads they are his workmanſhip; and conſequently his name in them is taken in vaine by vſuall ſwearing in ordinarie communication, and much more in periurie and falſe ſwearing, though not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly, yet indirectly and obliquely.</p>
                     <p>But they further vrge that our Sauiour expreſſely forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to ſweare at all,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>8.</hi> The former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection further vrged and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> and therefore wee muſt not ſweare neither by the creatures, nor by God himſelfe, neither truly nor falſely, neither in ordinarie communication, nor yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Magiſtrate. To which I anſwere, that theſe words, <hi>at all,</hi> are not to be referred to the oath it ſelfe, as though Chriſt ſhould forbid to ſweare in all caſes, which reference; as I haue ſhewed, implieth many abſurdities: but it is to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the forme and manner of the oath, namely, that we muſt not ſweare at all falſely, raſhly, and vſually in our ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie communication, neither directly by the name of God, nor indirectly by the creatures, which notwithſtanding the Phariſies taught to be lawfull. For that our Sauiour ſpeaketh here only of priuate oathes it is manifeſt, in that they did not in their publike oathes before the Magiſtrates ſweare by the creatures, but by the name of God alone. And ſo alſo it may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10736:11"/>bee gathered out of the text it ſelfe: for hee ſaith, let your communication, or ordinarie ſpeech one to another be, <hi>yea yea, nay nay:</hi> neither doth hee forbid them to ſweare by the name of God, which was vſed in publike oathes, but by the creatures, namely, the heauen, earth, altar, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>9.</hi> That an oath in priuate may be vſed lavvfully.</note> will ſome man ſay, but howſoeuer publike oathes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Magiſtrates, and for the confirming of new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerts in the truth of Chriſtian religion, may bee lawfull, yet priuate oathes are here vtterly condemned. I anſwere, that Chriſt here onely forbiddeth raſh, vaine and vſuall ſwearing, when neither the waightineſſe nor neceſſitie of the cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth it, as being a matter which is not worth the prouing, by ſuch a ſoueraigne witneſſe and Iudge, or which may bee proued by other arguments and witneſſes. Otherwiſe in waightie and neceſſarie cauſes, it is lawfull for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, the ending of controuerſies, the taking away of doubtings, iealouſies, and ſuſpitions, and for the preſeruing of a mans good name and credit,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.10.</note> to ſweare priuately as well as publikely, ſeeing the maine ends of a lawfull oath are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto, as well in the one as in the other.

Sect. <hi>1.</hi> vvhat things are required to a lavvfull oath.</note> In the next place we are to ſhew what oathes are lawfull, and what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; vnto a lawfull oath diuers things are required, wherof ſome reſpect the obiect of our oathes, ſome the end, and ſome the manner.<note place="margin">VVe muſt ſvveare onely by the name of the true God. <hi>Deut. 6.13.</hi>
                        </note> In reſpect of the obiect it is required that we ſweare onelie by the name of God, as may appeare by theſe reaſons; firſt, becauſe the Lord hath as ſtraitly commanded vs to ſweare by him alone, as to worſhip and ſerue him alone. So Deut. 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God and ſerue him,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eſa. 45.23. and 65.16.</note> 
                        <hi>and ſhalt ſweare by his name.</hi> Eſa. 45.23. <hi>I haue ſworne by my ſelfe, &amp;c. that euerie knee ſhall bow vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and euerie tongue ſhall ſweare by me.</hi> And 65.16. <hi>He that that ſhall bleſſe in the earth, ſhall bleſſe himſelfe in the true God, and hee that ſweareth in the earth, ſhall ſweare by the true God.</hi> And contrariwiſe the Lord hath as ſtrictly forbidden vs to ſweare by any other beſides himſelfe,<note place="margin">Ioſ. 23.7.</note> as appeareth, Ioſ. 23.7. <hi>Make no mention of the name of their gods, nor cauſe to ſweare by them, neither ſerue them, nor bow vnto them;</hi> which when the people of Iſrael neglected, the Lord threatneth to puniſh them for it.<note place="margin">Ier. 5.7.</note> Ier. 5.7. <hi>How ſhall I ſpare thee for this? thy children haue forſaken me, and ſworne by them that are no gods.</hi> Exod. 23.13.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Exod. 23.13.</note> a lawfull oath is a part of Gods worſhip, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of inuocation, and therefore they commit groſſe idolatrie who giue it to any other.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, all our actions muſt proceede from faith groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon Gods word, but in the whole Scriptures wee haue no warrant, neither by precept nor example, to ſweare di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly by any thing ſauing by the name of God, or to call ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angel or Saint as witneſſe to confirme a doubtful truth.</p>
                     <p>For whereas it is obiected that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſwore by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> Of Joſephs oath.</note> and that therefore it is lawfull to ſweare by the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10736:12"/>creatures; vnto this we may anſwere: Firſt that <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> to the end he might continue vnknowne vnto his brethren, tooke vpon him the cuſtome of the Egyptians, and therein ſinned through infirmitie, and therefore his example is no preſident for vs. Secondly, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> may be excuſed by the manner of his ſpeech; for he doth not ſay <hi>by the life of Pharaoh,</hi> but, <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh liueth,</hi> or, <hi>ſo let Pharaoh liue, as</hi> you ſhall not goe hence; which is not properly an oath, but a prayer added to an oath, wherein he deſireth God to grant that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might as certainely liue, as they ſhould not depart.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, whatſoeuer we ſweare by, that we deifie, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating vnto it Gods incommunicable attributes, as his omnipreſence, omniſcience, omnipotence, whereby he can powerfully protect his truth, and puniſh al falſhood; al which are ſo peculiar to God as that they cannot be communicated with any creature.</p>
                     <p>But is it then ſimply vnlawfull to vſe the name of any creature in our others?<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> VVhether vve may vſe the name of a creature in our oathes.</note> I anſwere, that it is vnlawfull to ſweare by them ſimply and directly; neuertheleſſe they may bee lawfully vſed in a compound forme of an oath, when as God by them is inuocated, as when wee pray for ſome good to befall vs, or them who are deare vnto vs, vpon the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our truth: or imprecate ſome euill, if we ſpeake falſely, or when we oblige thoſe things of which we make greateſt eſteeme, to Gods iuſtice, as ſureties of our truth. Examples whereof we haue 1.<note place="margin">1. Sam. 1.26. and 25.22.</note> Sam. 1.26. and 25.22</p>
                     <p>In reſpect then of the obiect we ſweare lawfully,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> Our oathes are vnlavvfull vvhen vve ſvveare by any thing beſides the true God, or ioyne any thing vvith him.</note> when we ſweare by the true <hi>Iehouah</hi> onely, and conſequently our oathes are vnlawful, when as we ſweare directly by any other thing. In which regard there are two kindes of vnlawfull oathes: firſt, when as we ſweare by any thing beſides the true God; ſecondly, when as in our oathes wee ioyne any other with him. They who vſe the former kinde of ſwearing commit the moſt impious kinde of theft, robbing God of his glorie, to beſtow it vpon an Idoll: the other ſhew their graceleſſe follie in making baſe Idols, and ſillie creatures, corriuals in honour and compeeres in the throne of iuſtice, vnto the Lord, who is the Creator of heauen and earth, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10736:12"/>the ſupreame Iudge and ſole Monarch of all the world. Of the former the Lord accuſeth the people of Iuda,<note place="margin">Ier. 5.7.</note> Ier. 5.7. <hi>Thy children haue forſaken me, and ſworne by them that are no Gods.</hi> Whereby is plainely implied that they who ſweare by any thing beſides the Lord, doe renounce him and his true worſhip;<note place="margin">Zeph. 1.4.5.</note> and for the latter he threatneth deſtruction, Zeph. 1.4.5. <hi>I will cut off them that worſhip and ſweare by the Lord. and ſweare by Malcham.</hi> For the Lord being the peereleſſe ſoueraigne of heauen and earth, cannot indure that any other ſhould haue,<note place="margin">Eſa 48.11.</note> or ſhare with him in, his glorie, as himſelfe alſo profeſſeth, Eſa. 48.11.</p>
                     <p>Here therefore are condemned all oathes which are not by the name of the true God;<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> Pettie and childiſh oathes vnlavvfull.</note> of which there are many kinds: firſt thoſe pettie, diminutiue, and childiſh oathes which are ſo much in vſe in theſe dayes; bodikin, lakin, by cocke, by my fey, and ſuch like; all which are the fruites of ignorance and ſuperſtition: for men ſeeing the vnexcuſable euill of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the glorious name of God, in their ordinarie commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, vpon euerie trifling occaſion, and hauing ſo inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their tongues to ſwearing, that they thinke there is a kinde of neceſſitie of vſing ſome kind of oathes, either for ornament of ſpeech, or to gaine more credit to their words; they imagine that God will excuſe them if they doe not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly take his name in vaine, but vſe onely theſe trifling and pettie oathes in their ordinarie ſpeech. But what is this but to ieſt with holy things, and to mocke the Lord, who will not be mocked? As though he regarded the pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and outward ſound more than the oath it ſelfe; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpleaſed, to haue his titles and attributes commonly vſed, ſhould be contented to haue them nick-named in a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous manner. What is it but quite to ouerthrow the lawfull vſe of an oath, which is ordained by God, onely for the confirmation of a waightie and neceſſarie truth, and not to be vſed ordinarilie and vpon euerie trifling occaſion? ſo that if the matter be light and vaine we muſt not ſweare at all; if ſo waightie that we may lawfully ſweare, then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is it lawfull to vſe the glorious name of God in an holy and religious manner.</p>

                        </note> here is condemned ſwearing by the creatures; as, by the Sunne, light, fire, bread, and ſuch like: which kind of oathes were in vſe among the Phariſies, as our Sauiour ſheweth, Matth. 5. and 23. and are commonly vſed amongſt ignorant worldlings in theſe dayes; wherein as they rob God of his glorie, and as it were ſpoile the Creator to enrich the creature, ſo doe they hereby exceedingly diſhonour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, in that being their ſuperiours by creation, they make themſelues inferiour vnto them in ſwearing by them: for as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>men ſweare by him that is greater then themſelues,</hi>

But that is but a weake proofe either of Gentilitie or Nobilitie, which is a manifeſt argument that wee are the ſlaues of Satan; it is no true courage deſperatly to leape into hell fire; and ordinarie
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10736:14"/>ſwearing is no ſigne of truth, ſeeing it vſually proceedeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a gulitie conceit of their owne want of credit: for if they thought their word worthie reſpect, to what purpoſe ſhould they vſe oathes? Nay rather vſuall ſwearing is a ſigne of the ſwearers falſehood; for therefore they ſweare becauſe their ſimple word is of no credit. And when they haue done all they can, an honeſt mans word is better to be eſteemed then al their oathes, <hi>nam qui deierat peierat,</hi> he that often ſweareth, often forſweareth.</p>

                     <p>And this is that falſe ſwearing, which in the word of God is principally condemned, and therfore to be of all Chriſtians auoided, as being a mother ſinne who in her fruitfull wombe containeth diuers impieties, and a compound wickedneſſe, compriſing in it diuers enormous tranſgreſſions; as hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall appeare.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond propertie required to a lawfull oath,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2. 2.</hi> VVe muſt ſweare in iuſtice.</note> is that we ſweare in iuſtice, which propertie hath his ſpeciall place in a promiſſorie oath; which when we make wee are carefully to take heede, that that which by oath wee promiſe be iuſt and lawfull; otherwiſe we are not to ſweare it, or hauing ſworne, not to performe it: for an oath ought not to be the bond of iniquitie; and, as one ſaith, thoſe oathes are laudably broken, which are vnlawfully made.</p>
                     <p>In this reſpect therefore our oath is vnlawfull, when as thereby we promiſe any thing which is vniuſt and vnhoneſt, whether it appeare vnto vs preſently when we make the oth, or afterwards. For this is a horrible wickedneſſe, when as we make God not only a witneſſe, but alſo our ſuertie, that wee will performe an vniuſt or vnhoneſt action. And ſuch was the oath of <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1. Sam. 25.21. of <hi>Gehezie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.21. 2. Kin. 5.20. 2 Kin. 6.31. Act. 23.12.</note> 2. King. 5.20. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab,</hi> 2.

                     <p>So if after the oath is made, wee finde that there is impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and iniuſtice in it, which wee did not diſcouer at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof, then ſuch an oath is rather to be broken then obſerued; for we ſinne not in breaking, but in making of it. Whereas he that performeth ſuch an oath, addeth ſinne vnto ſinne, that is to ſay, vnto raſhnes in ſwearing, wickedneſſe in performing: as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Herod,</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made a wicked oath,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.23.</note> did performe it with greater wickedneſſe. And this <hi>Dauid</hi> knew well, and therefore hee made no conſcience of breaking that vnlawfull oath, which he had vnconſcionably made, as appeareth 1. Sam. 25.21.3.</p>

And ſecondly, that we vſe it ſparingly, when as wee are neceſſarily vrged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. As when the perſon vnto whom wee ſweare can no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be perſwaded of a neceſſarie truth, when as the truth cannot be demonſtrated, by reaſon, teſtimonie, or other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, when as it is neceſſarie for the aduancement of Gods glorie, or for the furthering of ſome charitable worke, either publike or priuate, reſpecting either our neighbour or our ſelues. For ſeeing an oath is not abſolutely good but vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the condition of neceſſitie, therefore we muſt not ſweare but when ſome neceſſarie cauſe conſtraineth vs; for, <hi>bonum neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarium extra termines neceſſitatis non eſt bonum:</hi> that is, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie good is not good but when it is neceſſary. And hence it is that the Hebrew word vſed for ſwearing being paſſiue,<note place="margin">Iere. 4.2.

                     <p>Wee therefore ſweare vnlawfully when as wee doe not ſweare in iudgement, that is, when we ſweare vnreuerently, raſhly, and vnneceſſarily; in which reſpect men principallie offend when as no neceſſitie vrging them, vpon euery ſlight occaſion, idely, raſhly, and vainely they prophane the holie name of God in their ordinarie communication.

And, as another ſaith, <hi>for this cauſe our Lord forbiddeth, not onely to forſweare, but alſo to ſweare, leſt wee ſhould then onely ſeeme to ſpeake the truth when we confirme it by an oath; or leſt thoſe who ought to vtter nothing but truth in all their ſpeeches, ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

For either it is euill in him that ſweareth, as when he ſweareth voluntarily, vainly, and without cauſe; or when hauing made ſhipwrack of his credit by his cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable lying, he cannot gaine beliefe to his ſpeeches without an oath. Or elſe it is euill in him who compelleth another to an oath, when as cauſleſly he ſuſpecteth his truth, and wil not giue credit to his aſſertions or promiſes, though his word be of approued credit, and his whole courſe of life vpright and iuſt. The Apoſtle <hi>Iames</hi> alſo following in the ſteps of his Lord and Maſter, inforceth this commandement with no ſmall vehemencie:<note place="margin">Iam 5.12.</note> Iam. 5.12. <hi>Before all things, my brethren, ſweare not, neither by heauen, nor by earth, nor by any other oath: but let your yea be yea, and your nay nay, leſt you fall into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi> So that it is not a commandement of leaſt regard, or a matter of ſmall moment to abſtaine from vaine ſwearing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtle chargeth vs aboue al things to forbeare from theſe vnneceſſarie oathes, in our ordinarie communication, and to content our ſelues with a ſimple affirmation of the truth, and negation of that which is otherwiſe.</p>

                     <p>If we vſually ſweare by Gods holy name, we by making it common doe pollute and prophane it, contrarie to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe commandement of almightie God. Leu. 22.32. <hi>Ye ſhall not pollute my holie name,</hi>

What doe wee but moſt vngratefully diſhonour him, who took vpon him our fraile fleſh, indured a miſerable life, and ſuffered a curſed death that ſo hee might worke the worke of our redemption, make vs of the heires of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and firebrands of hell, the children of God, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the eternall ioyes of Gods kingdome?

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10736:20"/>of our ſins, and plunge our bodies and ſoules into a fearefull degree of condemnation? <hi>Iudas</hi> is a condemned wretch in hell, becauſe hee betrayed his maſter vnto the high Prieſts to be crucified, for thirtie peeces of ſiluer; what a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſentence then are they to expect, who themſelues cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and teare in peeces his moſt precious bodie, hauing no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement of pleaſure, profit, or credit, to draw them vnto it, but through meere vanitie or maliciouſneſſe, whereby they are readie to gratifie the diuell, by deſpiting God himſelfe? The ſouldiers are iuſtly taxed and reproued for parting but the garments of Ieſus Chriſt; and therefore how much more are they worthie of rebuke and puniſhment who diuide and teare in peeces his glorious and indiuiſible perſon, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood from his Godhead, his ſoule from his bodie, and all his bleſſed members one from another? The Iewes grieuouſly ſinned (as all confeſſe) in crucifying the Lord of life; but theſe blaſphemers ſinne in diuers reſpects much more grieuouſly: for they ſinned of ignorance, becauſe they did not know him to be the promiſed Meſſias; theſe of knowledge, after they haue confeſſed and profeſſed that hee is the Sauiour of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: they called vpon <hi>Pilate</hi> to haue him crucified, theſe crucifie him themſelues, and in ſtead of croſſe and nailes, they rend him in peeces betweene their owne teeth: they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted this ſinne but once, theſe innumerable times, euerie day in the yeere, euery houre in the day, ſpeaking no oftner then they do blaſpheme: they ſinned againſt him in the ſtate of humiliation when hee was but in the forme of a ſeruant; theſe after hee is exalted to glorie and maieſtie, ſitting at the right hand of God, as the ſoueraigne Lord and Iudge of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and earth.

As therefore they ſurpaſſe them in ſinne, ſo ſurely they ſhall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede them in puniſhment; and as it ſhall be eaſier for Tyre
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10736:20"/>and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah at the day of iudgement, then for the people of the Iewes; ſo ſhall it bee eaſier for the Iewes at that day, then for theſe blaſphemers.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we are to abhorre this vaine and prophane ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4. 3.</hi> Becauſe vaine ſvvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring doth ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the chiefe graces of Gods ſpirit.</note> becauſe it doth ſmother and choake in vs the chiefe graces of Gods ſpirit. As for example, inuocation and prayer; for with what face can we preſume in the time of want and affliction, to call vpon that name for helpe, which wee haue ſo often abuſed by prophane ſwearing? So alſo faith in Chriſts merits; for how can wee beleeue that Chriſts body was crucified for vs, which we ſo often and deſpitefully cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie vnto our ſelues afreſh, or that his blood ſhall waſh away our ſinnes, which by impious and prophane ſwearing wee haue ſo often trampled vnder our feete as an vnholy thing, making but a mocke of it? It ouerthroweth alſo our affiance in Chriſt, both in this life, and at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for how can wee truſt in him as our Sauiour, whom we daylie deſpite as though he were our enemie? how can wee when we are cited before the tribunall of Chriſt, hold vp our heades with any aſſurance of fauour, when as our conſciences ſhall tell vs, that we haue ſeldome remembred him, but to blaſpheme him, and haue more often named him in our oathes, then in our prayers?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, this vaine ſwearing is to be auoided,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5. 4.</hi> Becauſe this vice ill beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. <hi>2. Col. 4.6. Epheſ. 4.29.</hi>
                        </note> becauſe it is a vice which ill beſeemeth thoſe who make profeſſion of Chriſtianitie; for a Chriſtians ſpeech ſhould bee poudred with ſalt, and not with oathes; it ſhould not bee vnſauorie, and much leſſe ſtincking and noyſom: it ſhould miniſter grace to the hearers, and not like a contagious leproſie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the weake, nor like thornes and ſwords, vexe and grieue the ſtrong. For howſoeuer euill men can eaſilie paſſe it ouer, when they heare Gods name diſhonoured, as being a thing which doth not at all concerne them; yet if thoſe who truely feare the Lord and bee zealous of his glorie, heare theſe blaſphemies, their heart quaketh, their ioynts tremble, and their haire ſtandeth vp an end, as it is, Eccl. 27.14.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer it is an vndoubted badge, and infallible note of a prophane perſon who maketh conſcience of no ſinne,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10736:21"/>but would (if he might with as little danger or diſcredit doe it) commit any manner of wickedneſſe. And hence it is, that as <hi>Salomon</hi> maketh it a true note of a faithfull man, to haue a reuerent reſpect of an oath; ſo he pinneth it as a badge vpon the wicked mans ſleeue,<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.2.</note> that he maketh no conſcience of cuſtomable ſwearing. For as he parallelleth and oppoſeth the wicked to the iuſt, the pure to the polluted, the ſinner to the good man: ſo likwiſe, the vſuall ſwearer to him that feareth an oath. The reaſon is manifeſt, for if neither Gods loue, mercy, goodneſſe, nor the innumerable benefits which hee hath multiplied on them, can reſtraine them from this vaine and vnprofitable ſinne, wherin there is no reſpect, ſo much as of any worldly good; then we may vndoubtedly conclude, that were it not for feare of humane lawes, they would if their luſts mooued them, as eaſilie and readilie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adulterie, theft, or any other capitall ſinne, which haue the worldly baits of pleaſure, profit, or preferment to allure them; for he that will not ſticke to offend God, gratis, and for no benefit, will much more doe it, when he is hired with pleaſure or profit.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6. 5.</hi> Becauſe vaine ſwearing is an horrible abuſe of our tongues.</note> becauſe it is an horrible abuſe of our tongue, when as the Lord hauing giuen this excellent member, for the ſetting forth of his glorie, we abuſe it to his diſhonor, by blaſpheming our Creator, and make that which ſhould bee the trumpet of Gods praiſe, the trumpet of Satan, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clame warre againſt heauen, and an open defiance againſt God and all goodneſſe. Whereby we iuſtly deſerue (ſeeing we thus abuſe this excellent facultie of ſpeech, which the Lord hath priuiledged vs with, aboue all the reſt of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to the diſhonor of the giuer; and wheras the heauens declare the glorie of God and the earth ſheweth his handie worke, and all the reſt of the creatures in their ſeuerall kinds doe with their dumbe eloquence magnifie and praiſe their Creator, we contrariwiſe diſgrace him with helliſh blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and impious oathes:) we deſerue, I ſay, that the Lord ſhould ſtrike vs with preſent dumbnes, and caſt vs out as hee did <hi>Nebucadnezer,</hi> from the ſocietie of men, amongſt the brute and ſauage beaſts, till with him we haue learned to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10736:21"/>ſpeake to Gods glorie, and to magnifie the mercie of our Creator.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, we are to auoid vaine ſwearing,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>7. 6.</hi> Becauſe it is a cauſe and forerunner of periurie.</note> as being a notable cauſe and neceſſarie forerunner of that damnable ſinne of periurie; <hi>nam qui deierat, peierat,</hi> he that often ſweareth, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forſweareth. To which purpoſe one ſaith: <hi>Caue facilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem turandi; cum de facilitate naſcatur conſuetudo ex conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine periurium, ex periurio blaſphemia;</hi> beware of inclinablenes to ſweare in ordinarie communication; for of inclinablenes ariſeth cuſtome, of cuſtome, periurie, and of periurie, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemie. And this commeth to paſſe, both becauſe cuſtome of ſwearing taketh away all reuerent regard of an oath, vpon which followeth forgetfulneſſe of that which is ſworne, and ſo vtter neglect of performance; and alſo, becauſe mens tongues being inured thereunto, doe as familiarly vſe it, as a ſimple affirmation and negation, and conſequently they doe no oftener affirme an vntruth, then they are readie to confirme it with the deepeſt oathes. An example where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we haue in <hi>Saul,</hi> who being the greateſt ſwearer that wee read of in the Scriptures, and making no conſcience of an oath, made as little account of damnable periurie,<note place="margin">1.

                     <p>Seuenthly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>8. 7.</hi> Becauſe vaine ſwearers haue a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full account to make at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> let vs flee this prophane vice of common ſwearing, alwaies remembring that ſwearers haue a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full account to make at the day of iudgement. For if an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt be giuen of euerie idle word, then how much more of euerie vaine and bloodie oath? if they ſhall not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape puniſhment, who haue ſpoken idly and vainely, how fearefull ſhall their condemnation bee, who in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie talke haue ſpoken impiouſly and blaſphemouſlic?</p>
                     <p>Eightly,<note place="margin">§.

He is ſo bounteous that he hath not ſpared to giue vnto vs his onely begotten and dearly beloued ſonne, in whom hee was delighted and well pleaſed, and that to the death euen the bitter and curſed death of the croſſe: and ſhall we be ſo wickedly vngratefull, that we will not at his ſute, part with a ſinne, which hath in it no reſpect of good, pleaſure, profit, or credit, and contrariwiſe is hurtfull and pernicious both to our bodies and ſoules? If Gods infinite loue, mercie, and innumerable benefits ſhould ſo worke vpon our hearts and conſciences, that the ſtrongeſt inducements, and moſt allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring baites ſhould not mooue and intice to commit any ſin willingly and againſt our knowledge, then ſhame, confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and vtter deſtruction iuſtly attend thoſe who either through wantonneſſe, or maliciouſneſſe, fall into this ſinne, hauing no reaſon in reſpect of pleaſure, profit, or credit to perſwade them thereunto: according to the prayer of the Pſalmiſt,<note place="margin">Pſal. 25.3.</note> Pſal, 25.3. <hi>Let them be confounded that tranſgreſſe without a cauſe.</hi>

For in this life the Lord hath threatned againſt wicked ſwearers a whole volume of his curſes, Zach. 5.3. Which are ſaid to be regiſtred in a book, to ſhew vnto vs, that ſeeing they are kept vpon record, they ſhal ſurely be remembred;<note place="margin">Zach. 5.3.</note> in a large volume of twentie cubits long, and ten cubits broad, to note the multitude of Gods plagues which ſhall be inflicted vpon the ſwearer; and in a flying booke, to ſhew the ſwiftneſſe of Gods vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſin, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quicke diſpatch he will make in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, though they be ſcattered far and wide vpon the face of the earth.

And the rather, let all in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie be perſwaded hereunto; firſt, becauſe where one is tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10736:23"/>with this leproſie, if ſeparation be not made, hee will likewiſe infect thoſe that are about him. As therefore Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and houſholders in the time of common ſickneſſe are verie carefull to ſtay the infection, by keeping the ſicke from the whole: ſo the like or much greater care muſt bee had in keeping theſe who are infected with this contagious ſinne of vaine ſwearing, from thoſe who are not yet tainted, either till they be reformed and cured, or if they be vncurable, by baniſhing them out of the common wealth, and excluding them out of the familie; or at leaſt by inflicting vpon the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders ſuch ſeuere puniſhments as may vtterly diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance this ſinne, and diſcourage and deterre others from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their leaud example.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>12.</hi> The impunitie of one ſinner bringeth Gods iudgements vpon the whole familie.</note> becauſe where any one enormous ſin raigneth in any member of a ſocietie, which is not ſuppreſſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, or at leaſt corrected and ſharply puniſhed, that ſinne will bring Gods vengeance and fearfull iudgements, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon the offender, but alſo vpon the whole bodie of that ſocietie. For in reſpect of that neere communion which is betweene the diuers members of the ſame bodie politicke; it commeth to paſſe oftentimes that both their proſperitie, and aduerſitie, benefits, and puniſhments are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. So that as for the ſakes of ſome few godly men, the whole ſocietie fareth the better; ſo for the ſinnes of ſome few, which are either defended, wincked at, or not puniſhed; Gods temporarie iudgements are inflicted vpon the whole body, whether it be a priuate familie, or the whole common wealth. Of the former we haue an example in <hi>Elies</hi> houſe, ruined and ſubuerted through the vncorrected finnes of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinees;</hi>

Doth not (ſay they) the Lord himſelf inioyne ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as a part of his worſhip and ſeruice?<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13.</note> and doth not the Pſalmiſt tell vs,<note place="margin">Pſal. 63.11.</note> that all who ſweare by the Lord ſhall reioyce before him? the more therefore we ſweare, the better ſeruice we doe vnto God, and the greater cauſe of true reioycing we procure vnto our ſelues. To this I anſwere, that if they would examine themſelues aright, their owne conſciences would tell them, that in their vaine ſwearing they do not propound vnto themſelues, as their ends, Gods glorie, and their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reioycing, but rather ſweare to deſpite God in their rage, when they cannot haue their will; or in a brauerie to grace themſelues with this helliſh ornament. And therefore when by theſe ends they defend their ſwearing, they doe but play the graceleſſe hypocrites, couering their foule ſin vnder this faire vizard. But though we leaue the ranſacking of their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10736:24"/>hearts vnto the Lord who is the only ſearcher of them, and take their reaſons as they propound them, yet will they make little for their vaine ſwearing, but rather much againſt it. For as when the Lord inioyneth his true worſhip, hee doth not thereby approue of all manner of worſhip which is done vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but only that which himſelfe preſcribeth; yea rather thereby forbiddeth and condemneth all humane inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will-worſhip, and ſuperſtitious meanes of his ſeruice, and reſtraineth vs both for the matter and manner vnto his reuealed will: ſo when the Lord commandeth and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vnto vs a lawfull oath, that hereby his name may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, the truth cleered and defended, and we diſcerned from Heathens, Pagans, and all manner of idolaters; he doth not approue of vaine ſwearing, for in his law he hath abſolutely condemned this taking of his name in vaine, but that wee ſweare in that manner which hee hath preſcribed, in truth, righteouſnes, and iudgement: that is, for confirming of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie truth, which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by no other lawful means be cleered, and not vpon euery vaine and trifling occaſion; with feare and reuerence of Gods Maieſtie, as being in his preſence, and not in a ſwaggering humour, impiouſly and irreligiouſly ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in our othes neither at Gods glory, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good of men.</p>
                     <p>Others there are who are not come to that audacious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, to defend their vaine ſwearing as lawfull,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> The excuſe of vaine ſwearing by cuſtome ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken avvay.</note> and yet neuertheleſſe if they be taxed and reprooued for it, will not ſticke to pretend many excuſes, why either they cannot or will not leaue it. Some alleage for their excuſe, that they haue been inured to ſuch a naughtie cuſtome of ſwearing, that howſoeuer they diſallow it in themſelues, yet they fall into it at vnawares, and can by no meanes giue it ouer. But did they euer indeede condemne it as a ſinne, and themſelues for falling into it? Were they euer ſeriouſly and ſoundly grieued at their hearts, becauſe thereby they haue diſpleaſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honored God? Do they lothe and hate this wicked cuſtome, and earneſtly labour to weane themſelues from it? Alas their conſciences tell them that they doe nothing leſſe; but either that they careleſly neglect to ſet a watch before their lips that they may not thus offend, or that what ſhew ſoeuer they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10736:24"/>make to the contrarie, they like and loue their ſinne, and take a pride in vſing of it. Wherof it muſt needs follow, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer theſe men pleaſe themſelues, as though all were well, and haue put their ſecure conſciences to ſilence by this vaine excuſe, yet in truth their eſtate is moſt wretched, ſeeing they are content to liue in a known ſin without repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance, which, if it be finall, will enter them into the certen poſſeſſion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death. Yea but many of them will ſay, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of their ſinne, for after they haue vainly ſworne they ſmite themſelues on the breaſt, and aske God forgiueneſſe. O blindneſſe to be pitied if it were not wilfully affected! Is this the mends which thou makeſt, in hypocriticall manner to ſmite thy breaſt, for piercing of thy Sauiour? Is this a prayer acceptable vnto God, or like to returne with fruite into thy boſome, when thou askeſt forgiuenes with a purpoſe ſtill to offend, and deſireſt his pardon, as a priuiledge, by vertue whereof thou maiſt ſecurely goe forward in thy ſinne? Is this the repentance which God requireth to ſmite the breaſt, and to aske forgiueneſſe with fained lips? when as in the meane time the heart is not ſmitten at all with bitter griefe, nor earneſtly reſolued in a true hatred to leaue this ſinne ſo vaine, and ſo vnprofitable? If for euery oath theſe ſwearers ſhould ſuſtaine the leaſt worldly loſſe, or indure the leaſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily puniſhment, euen the loſſe of a groat, or the ſmart of a phillip, it would ſoone reclaime them from their euill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; and yet ſo baſely doe they eſteeme the ſaluation of their ſoules, ſo little doe they feare the helliſh torments, ſo ſlenderly doe they regard the Lords commandement, and ſo meane a reſpect they haue of his Maieſtie either to loue, or feare him, that they cannot finde in their hearts to weane themſelues from this wicked cuſtome of vaine ſwearing, which bringeth vnto them no benefit, no not ſo much as any worldly profit or aduantage. Say therefore no more that it is an vnreſiſtable cuſtome, but rather thy carnall prophanenes, and vtter contempt of God, which continueth thee in this ſinne. Neither alleage any longer this vaine excuſe, which doth but proclaime thy follie and aggrauate thy fault; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it queſtionable whether thy ſottiſhnes or impietie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10736:25"/>one the other. For, may not any other ſinner after the ſame manner pleade poſſeſſion of their ſinne as well as thou? may not the murtherer ſay, I cannot leaue murthering of my neighbour, becauſe I haue bin ſo often fleſhed by killing and ſlaying? may not the adulterer with as good reaſon and more neceſſitie, excuſe his adulteries, becauſe by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome he hath gotten ſuch an habit of whoredome, that hee cannot leaue it? may not a theefe when hee is arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Iudge as well excuſe his theft, by alleaging that hee hath ſo long continued in his rapine and robberie, that hee hath no power to reclaime himſelfe from ſtealing? Now if in theſe caſes euery one would condemne ſuch excuſes as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, and the excuſers as outragiouſly impious; becauſe cuſtomable liuing in ſinne exceedingly aggrauateth the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes of the ſinner; then why ſhould wee not condemne this excuſe of ſwearers of like folly and impietie, when as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reprooued for ſwearing at ſome times, they pleade for themſelues, that it is their ordinarie cuſtome, and therefore they cannot leaue it. For if it be a ſin to ſweare once or twice, then is it out of meaſure ſinfull, to make an ordinarie practiſe of it, and ſo to bring vpon our ſelues an habit of ſwearing.</p>

If pietie and the true feare of God were rooted in their hearts, they would not from theſe good trees bring foorth ſuch euill fruites;<note place="margin">Mat 7.16.20. Iam. 3.10.11.</note> if they were pure fountaines ſeaſoned with Gods grace, they would neuer ſend forth ſuch bitter and polluted ſtreames, neither would they blaſpheme God with their mouth, if they bleſſed him in their hearts. In a word, if they had any dramme of true religion ſeated in the heart, it would bridle the tongue, and reſtraine it from vaine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10736:25"/>ſwearing: for what ſinne will a man leaue for Gods ſake, if he will not leaue this which is euerie way vnprofitable, and manie waies hurtfull? And therfore we may conclude, with the Apoſtle, that <hi>if any man amongſt vs ſeemeth religious, and refraineth not his tongue, he deceiueth his owne heart, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is vaine.</hi> Iam. 1.26.<note place="margin">Iam. 1.26.</note> Neither let them thinke that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they excuſe themſelues, God will haue them excuſed; ſeeing he hath plainely told them, that they ſhall giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for euerie idle word, and therefore much more for vaine and impious oathes; and that when he commeth to iudge, he will paſſe the ſentence, not according to our ſecret thoughts, but according to our words and workes. Matth.<note place="margin">Matt. 12.37.</note> 12.37. <hi>By thy words thou ſhalt bee iuſtified, and by thy words thou ſhalt be condemned.</hi> Neither let them ſuppoſe that this excuſe which would ſeeme friuolous and fooliſh to a mortall man, will goe for currant before the moſt wiſe and iuſt Iudge of heauen and earth. Now what Prince, hearing himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to his face by the reprochfull words of his baſe ſubiect, would admit of ſuch an excuſe, that whatſoeuer hee ſpoke with his mouth, yet hee thought no ill in heart; and will not, thinke we, the Lord be as iealous of his glorie, which is moſt deare vnto him, as an earthly King? or will hee in his iuſtice acquite ſuch offenders vpon ſuch friuolous and vaine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences?</p>
                     <p>Others ſhroude their ſinne vnder the example of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,<note place="margin">§.

But let ſuch know, that after this manner they may excuſe and countenance any manner of wickedneſſe, ſeeing no cuſtome is more common then to liue in ſinne. Let them remember that God hath forbidden vs to follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a multitude in that which is euill;<note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note> or to faſhion our ſelues according to the world, whereof we are but pilgrims, if at leaſt we be inhabitants of the heauenly Ieruſalem; that Chriſt hath choſen vs out of the world, not that we ſhould ſtill imbrace the impious practiſes of wicked worldlings, but that becomming his Diſciples, we ſhould follow his word and holy example, as our onely guides. Let them conſider,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10736:26"/>that common vſe of committing ſinne doth not excuſe, but much aggrauate it in Gods ſight, and that it doth more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame his wrath, and increaſe the puniſhment, when as men combine themſelues to worke wickedneſſe. Finally, let them call to minde, that it is the narrow path and ſtraite gate lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to eternall life,<note place="margin">Matth. 7.13.14.</note> which is leaſt frequented, ſo that the Chriſtian may goe in it without crouding, though it be not large and ſpacious, in reſpect of the ſmall number which tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile this way: and contrariwiſe, that there is no way more commonly haunted then the broade way, which leadeth to deſtruction; and conſequently, that wee can haue ſmall comfort in hauing a numerous multitude to accompanie vs into hell.</p>
                     <p>Others alleage in their excuſe,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> Their excuſe taken away, who alleage that they ſweare nothing but the truth.</note> that they ſweare nothing but the truth, which may lawfully be confirmed with an oath. But as I haue ſhewed, Gods name is prophaned and abuſed, not onely (although moſt grieuouſlie) when wee ſweare that which is falſe, but alſo, when it is vſed vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry trifling occaſion, to confirme an vnneceſſarie truth, which either is not worth proouing, or may be demonſtrated by other arguments; or without that reuerend and religious reſpect of his glorious Maieſtie which he requireth.</p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6.</hi> Their excuſe anſwered, vvho pretend that they ſvveare by ſmall oathes.</note> but will ſome ſay, I auoide this danger, ſeeing my cuſtome is not to ſweare by God, but by ſlight and ſmall oathes, as by my faith, troth, by our Lady, the maſſe, and ſuch like: and therefore I am to be excuſed, becauſe I do not take the name of God in vaine. To this I haue alreadie anſwered, whereas I prooued that the Lord requireth that we ſhould ſweare by his name only: to which I may adde, that our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath directly forbidden ſuch kind of oathes, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vs in our ordinary co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.34.</note> to vſe only, yea yea, nay nay; telling vs that whatſoeuer is more, commeth of euil. Though therefore it be not ſo hainous a ſin, as that horrible abuſing of Gods holy name, yet it is a ſin, ſeeing Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe hath forbidden and condemned it; and therefore not to be entertained, and much leſſe excuſed or defended by any Chriſtian. For wee ſhould thinke no ſinne ſo ſmall that wee may willingly commit it, ſeeing the leaſt ſinne meriteth the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10736:26"/>wages of eternall death, and can no otherwiſe be expiated and done away, but by the ineſtimable price of Chriſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood; or if we doe, let vs aſſure our ſelues it ſhall not be ſmall vnto vs; for the leaſt ſinne in it owne nature is hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and vnpardonable, ſo long as it is willingly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and excuſed or defended.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>7.</hi> Their excuſe anſwered, who alleage others incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie.</note> they excuſe themſelues by alleadging the incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulitie and ſuſpition of others, which is ſuch, that vnleſſe they ſweare they cannot be credited and beleeued. But vnto this I anſwere, that the beſt way to haue our words credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is not to confirme euerie thing we ſpeake with an oath, for ſo our oathes becomming common and ordinarie, will be as little reſpected as a ſimple affirmation; nay in truth they will deſerue leſſe credit: for it is to be thought that hee who maketh no conſcience of tranſgreſſing one commandement, will not make much more conſcience of tranſgreſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; he that ſticketh not to vſe deieration and vaine ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, will not ſticke at periurie and forſwearing; or if he doe, it is not becauſe he wanteth an heart to doe it, but rather ſome ſtrong inducement to perſwade him. But the beſt way to haue our ſpeeches credited, is to accuſtome our tongues to ſpeake the truth, and to be of an vpright, iuſt, and vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life and conuerſation; and ſo ſhall our word be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded than anothers oath; for it is not the oath that giueth credit and authoritie to a man, but a man to his oath; and if in our whole courſe and cariage we clearely ſhew, that we make more conſcience of lying, than another of periurie, his oath will not be ſo much credited, as our bare promiſe or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion. Whereby it appeareth that ordinarie ſwearing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther needleſſe or booteleſſe. For if a man be of an holy and religious conuerſation, there will be no vſe of it, vnleſſe it be in waightie cauſes, wherein an oath is lawfull; becauſe his word will carrie with it ſufficient credit: and contrariwiſe, if he be knowne to haue accuſtomed himſelfe to lying, diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and falſe dealing, his ſwearing will not profit him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his vnconſcionable falſehood, doth take away all credite and authoritie from his oath.</p>

                     <p>The third meanes to auoid vaine ſwearing,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>6.</hi> The <hi>3.</hi> meanes is to be ſparing in the vſe of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuerations.</note> is to be ſparing in the vſe of earneſt aſſeuerations and proteſtations; for theſe are as it were the outward and next adioyning fences, the vſe whereof is to preſerue Gods glorious name from being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned and trampled vpon by common vſe; and therefore ſo long as we ſparingly and reuerently approch vnto them, wee will be much more reſpectiue in vſing the name of God by an oath; whereas if wee vſually leape ouer the fence, and by prophane and common vſe tread it downe and trample it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote, then the fence being taken away, the holy name of God himſelfe lieth open to be prophaned by vaine ſwearing. Aſſeuerations are as it were the banke and brinke of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10736:28"/>and vaine ſwearing like a deepe miſchieuous pit fit to ſwallow and drowne vs if wee fall into it. So long therefore as we walke aloofe, and doe not approch the banke but vpon waightie occaſion, and with great care and circumſpection, we keepe our ſelues out of all danger; but if wee be ſtill lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vpon the banck, and careleſly dancing vpon the very brinck, it is a thouſand to one we ſhall ſlip in and periſh, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we riſe again and recouer our ſelues by true repentance. Again, if it be obſerued that we are ſparing in the vſe of theſe aſſeuerations, vnleſſe it be in waightie affaires and with great reuerence and reſpect, then will it gaine vnto them ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, that wee ſhall neuer bee vrged by ſwearing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our ſpeeches; euery one being readie more to eſteeme and credit our honeſt proteſtation, then the deepe oathes of thoſe who accuſtome their tongues to vaine ſwearing.</p>
                     <p>The fourth meanes to auoide this ſinne of vaine ſwearing,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>7.</hi> The fourth meanes is to auoid the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of vaine ſvvearers.</note> is to ſhun the companie of ſuch as much vſe it; becauſe our corrupt nature is eaſily infected, if we doe but breathe in the contagious aire of ſinne. And as ciuill men liuing amongſt a barbarous people, quickly loſe the puritie of their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and haue their ſpeech corrupted with the barbariſmes that are daily ſounding in their eares; ſo if being religious we haunt the companie of theſe curſed Edomites, who inure their tongues to blaſphemous ſwearing, we ſhal ſoone forget to ſpeak the pure language of holy Chanaan, and corrupt our ſpeech with vaine and wicked oathes. And therefore let no man preſume vpon his owne ſtrength, and flatter himſelfe with a vaine conceit, that hee ſo abhorreth this cuſtomable ſwearing, that he is in no danger of being corrupted with it, though hee frequent ſuch leud companie. For there is little hope we ſhall long firmely ſtand in ſuch ſlippery places: firſt, becauſe it is iuſt with God to withdraw his aſſiſting grace from thoſe, who tempt him with their preſumption, and that they who ſo loue tentations that they wilfully runne into them, ſhould alſo fall and bee ouercome in the day of triall. Secondly, becauſe by reaſon of our corruption, wee are prone to fall into any ſinne; for the ſeedes of all euill remaining in vs, will, when they ſeeme dead and rotten, reuiue and ſprout
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10736:29"/>vp againe, when as they are, as it were watred and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, with the wicked examples and incouragements of prophane companions. And the tindar of our corruption is eaſily ſet on fire with the touch of the leaſt ſparke of an euill preſident, if it be not extinguiſhed by Gods Spirit. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe ſuch companie will euen compell vs, with a kind of vrgent neceſſitie, to follow their owne practiſe, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to giue credit vnto our words, vnleſſe an oath be added for confirmation; for they who accuſtome their tongues to vaine ſwearing, will hardly beleeue another man without an oath.</p>

Others who had inured their tongues to ſweare by the blood and wounds of Chriſt, at their death in fearful manner haue had vnſtanchable iſſues of blood ouer all their bodies. Others haue died vttering horrible blaſphemies with their laſt breath, and ſo haue been apprehended by the Iudge, as it were, with their theft about them, and ſommoned before his iudgement ſeate, whileſt they were executing the very act of treaſon againſt Gods glorious Maieſtie. And for concluſion, at the day of iudgement, when as they ſhall be arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his tribunall ſeate, and there indicted for their manifold
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10736:29"/>abuſing of his glorious name; the Lord hath ſaid that hee will not hold them guiltleſſe, but they ſhall for euer beare their fearfull condemnation. What follie therefore is it, yea what more then franticke madneſſe, for a man to hazard his bodie and ſoule, which are of more worth vnto him, then ten thouſand worlds, to the ſuffering of all theſe fearfull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, both in this life and in the life to come, for a vaine and vnprofitable ſinne, which bringeth good to neither ſoule nor bodie, as before I haue ſhewed?</p>

For the firſt; <hi>Periurie is nothing elſe but falſe ſwearing.</hi> Or more fullie, <hi>It is a knowne or imagined vntruth, confirmed by oath, ioyned with deceit, which was either purpoſed and intended before the oath was made, or reſolued on afterwards.</hi> Whereby it
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10736:30"/>appeareth that two things doe alwaies concurre in periurie: firſt the generall matter thereof, which is an vntruth: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the forme which giueth being vnto it, namely, a falſe oath, made with purpoſed and affected deceit, or reſolued on afterwards. Now, vntruth is either logicall or morall. Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, when as wee doe not ſpeake as the thing is, or when as our ſpeech agreeth not with the thing. Morall vntruth is, when as wee doe not ſpeake as wee thinke, or when as our ſpeech agreeth not with our minde. Of the former wee doe not heere ſpeake; neither doth it make periurie, but onely when it is ioyned with the ſecond; whereas the morall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth confirmed with an oath is periurie, although it be a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall truth. More plainly, if I ſweare an vntruth, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that it is true, it may bee my oath may iuſtly deſerue the cenſure of raſhnes or prophanenes; but yet I am not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, becauſe my ſpeech agreeth with my minde, though not with the thing: neither doe I ſweare falſely, although that which I ſweare be falſe, in that I doe not ſweare with a minde to deceiue, but being my ſelfe deceiued: whereas con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe if I ſweare an vntruth, knowing it to be ſo, yea if I ſweare as the truth is, being perſwaded in the meane time, that it is falſe and vntrue,<note place="margin">Ream linguam facit mens rea. Plato.</note> I fall into the ſinne of periurie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe my ſpeech and oath agree not with my minde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, though it agreeth with the thing; and the end of my oath is not to confirme the truth, but to deceiue thoſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I ſweare. And this kinde of periurie whereby a man deceitfully ſweareth that which he thinketh falſe to be true, is an hainous ſinne in Gods ſight, though afterwards it fall out to be indeed the truth, and as well excludeth him out of Gods kingdome, as when a man ſweareth that which hee knoweth certainly is falſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 24.4.</note> to be true, as appeareth Pſal. 24.4. For if it be a grieuous ſin and an euident ſigne of an impious man,<note place="margin">Pſal. 12.1.2.</note> to ſpeake deceitfully and with a double heart vnto his neighbour; then how much more abominable is it, when as this deceit is graced and countenanced with an oath?</p>
                     <p>Yea,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> Hovv our oath is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, being am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous.</note> but ſeeing our ſpeech is often ambiguous, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a double ſignification, wherof it commeth to paſſe, that I ſwearing in one ſenſe am vnderſtood in another; how
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10736:30"/>is ſuch an oath to be expounded and performed, as that I may bee cleared from deceit and periurie? Some anſwere, that our oath muſt be vnderſtood in his ſenſe and meaning vnto whome it is made. But this is too ſtrict and hard, for ſo a man might be periured ſwearing, both according to the truth, and according to his owne minde and perſwaſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is miſunderſtood through the default perhaps of the other, who wanteth capacitie and apprehenſion. What then, muſt it be vnderſtood in his ſenſe and meaning that ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth? If this ſhould be granted, it would bee as ouer-partiall on the other ſide, for ſo might men ſpeake doubtfully with a purpoſe to miſlead another, and by equiuocation may ſweare that which is true in his owne meaning and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is neuertheleſſe directly falſe, according to his conſtruction vnto whom the oath is made: and therefore the moſt equall courſe that can bee taken for the auoiding of both extreames is, that our ſpeech which we confirme with an oath bee vnderſtood moſt ſimply &amp; plainly, according to the vſual and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon cuſtome, as the moſt part do, and ought to vnderſtand ſuch ſpeeches. And if yet any doubt remaine, the ſureſt rule is, that the ſpeech confirmed by oath, bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood according to the ſenſe and meaning of him vnto whom the oath is made, if the ſwearer did ſweare deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; or if ſimply, plainly, and with an honeſt meaning, then is it to bee interpreted in his owne ſenſe who tooke the oath.</p>
                     <p>Where by the way we may obſerue,<note place="margin">§.

But whatſoeuer flowriſhes they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10736:31"/>make to hide their impietie, yet this their doctrine and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe is wicked and abominable, and their oathes no better then periurie, and that in the moſt impious kinde, in Gods ſight; ſeeing vnto their periurie, is ioyned diuelliſh deceit, which euen in the iudgement and practife of the Heathens was condemned and abhorred; for their vſuall forme of ſwearing was, <hi>Ex animi mei ſententia iuro,</hi> I ſweare according to the true meaning of my heart; and they deteſted as impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and atheiſticall that ſpeech,<note place="margin">Cic. de Legib.</note>

And yet the admired Ieſuites, who could find no name fit to expreſſe the holines of their order, but the ſacred name of Ieſus, being in this, as in manie other things, much more wicked then the Heathens, commonly vſe, and ſtiflie defend this periurious practiſe of falſe and deceitfull ſwearing.</p>

                        </note> In the next place we are to ſpeake of the kinds ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the which may be diſtinguiſhed according to the ſeuerall kinds of a lawfull oath; for as a true and lawfull oath is either aſſertorie, which is the affirmation and confirmation of the truth, concerning that which is paſt, or preſent, by an oath; or elſe promiſſorie, whereby wee bind our ſelues by oath to performe our promiſe concerning things to come: ſo likewiſe, periurie is either aſſertorie, or promiſſorie.</p>
                     <p>Aſſertorie periurie is, wherby wee ſweare that to bee true,<note place="margin">Of aſſertorie periurie.</note> which we either know or thinke to be falſe; or contrariwiſe, that to be falſe, which we either know or thinke to be true. So that there are two ſpeciall kinds of this periurie; the firſt, when as we confirme by oath that which we know certainly to be falſe; the other, when as we ſweare that to be true, which we thinke is falſe, though afterwards it may fall out to be true. For though the thing be true, yet he who taketh the oath ſweareth falſly, becauſe his ſpeech agreeth not with his mind, and his ſcope is to deceiue him to whom he ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and conſequently it is no better then plaine periurie, and all one in Gods ſight as if the thing were falſe: for as the maine end of a lawfull and religious oath is the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of truth; ſo the end of periurie is falſhood and deceit.</p>
                     <p>Promiſſorie periurie is, whereby we either plainly or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly promiſe that by oath, which wee intend not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme;<note place="margin">§.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10736:32"/>we may, the thing promiſed being both lawfull and poſſible. Whereby it appeareth, that there are two ſorts of this periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie alſo; firſt, when as we intend at the making of our oath, not to performe it, which is a horrible and high degree of wickedneſſe, when as wee call vpon God by oath, not onely to be a witneſſe and Iudge of that we ſweare; but alſo our ſuretie that we will keepe our promiſe, in the meane time intending nothing leſſe then to performe our oath. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, when hauing at the taking of our oath ſimply, and ſincerely promiſed that which we purpoſed to performe, wee afterwards vnconſtantly breake our promiſe, becauſe wee either thinke, or find it inconuenient, howſoeuer the thing promiſed be both lawfull and poſſible. And both theſe are done two waies; firſt plainly, when as our promiſes are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt and void of al ambiguitie; the other cunningly, when as of ſet purpoſe to deceiue, we frame our words ſo ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and doubtfully, that propounding them in one ſenſe vnto him who taketh our oath, we may vnderſtand them in another; and ſo performe our oathes not according to the outward appearance of the words, and as the other concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of them, but according to that meaning which we haue ſecretly framed vnto our ſelues: as if a Captaine in warre ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken many priſoners, ſhould bind himſelfe by oath to the enemie to deliuer halfe the Captiues, vpon ſuch a ſum deliuered for their ranſome, and hauing receiued the price according to couenant, ſhould in ſtead of halfe the number, as the other vnderſtood him, ſend halfe the bodies of the whole number, as in his oath he guilfullie intended: or like <hi>Cleomenes,</hi>

And this is made a true ſigne of one who is a ſound member of the militant Church, and an aſſured heire of the Kingdome of glorie, when as he abhorres deceitfull ſwearing,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15 4.</note> and performeth thoſe oathes which are made to his owne hinderance.

                     <p>But if the things which by oath we promiſe, be vnlawfull or impoſſible, then ſuch oathes doe not binde the conſcience,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10736:33"/>but are preſently voide, as ſoone as the vnlawfulnes or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilitie appeareth.<note place="margin">Jſidorus.</note> For an oath ought not to be the bond of iniquitie; and thoſe oathes are laudably broken, which are vnlawfully made; neither can they tie vs vnto impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, becauſe the things ſo promiſed are out of our power to performe them. But that we may ſpeake of them more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly, an oath is vnlawfull, firſt, when as wee ſweare to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme ſuch things, as are repugnant and contrarie to the law and reuealed will of God; and therefore is not to bee obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: firſt, becauſe by ſuch an oath we make the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our teſtimonie againſt himſelfe, and to bee our ſuretie for the performance of that, which is wicked and odious in his ſight. Secondly, becauſe theſe oathes made vnto men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe and diſanull our oath which wee haue formerly made vnto God in baptiſme, whereby we haue bound our ſelues to yeeld abſolute obedience vnto Gods reuealed will. Now this ought not to be, both becauſe our firſt oath muſt ſtand, as hauing already bound our conſcience to performance, and therefore may not be fruſtrated and made void with a latter; and alſo becauſe an oath made vnto God, muſt bee preferred before an oath made vnto men; in that hee is our ſupreme Iudge, and ſoueraigne Lord, vnto whom we owe our ſelues, our obedience and fealtie, and all that belongeth vnto vs. Euen as an after oath made to a rebell, enemie, or ſtranger, cannot diſanull our former oath, whereby we haue obliged our ſelues to yeeld obedience to our lawfull Prince.</p>
                     <p>Now an oath is vnlawful and wicked in this regard,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> Valavvſulnes of an oath is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparant, or diſcerned by the euent.</note> either in preſent appearance when it is made, or in the proofe and euent. Of the former we haue an example in <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> ſwearing the death of innocent <hi>Elias;</hi> and in the Iewes, who bound themſelues by oath to ſlay <hi>Paul.</hi> And ſuch is the oath of our Popiſh fugitiues,<note place="margin">1. King. 19.2. Act. 23.</note> who thereby binde themſelues to bee the vaſſals of Antichriſt, denying their due allegiance and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their lawful Soucraigne; which is expreſly contrarie to the word of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 13.1.2.3 Matth 22.21. Tir. 3, 1. 1. Pet. 2.13.</note> as appeareth Rom. 13.1.2.3. All which kind of othes are hainouſly wicked when they are firſt made. For if knowing them at the time of their taking of them to be wicked and vnlawfull, they doe not at all intend to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10736:33"/>them, they ſinne grieuouſly againſt God by ſwearing falſely; their ſpeech not agreeing with their minde, and by prophaning his holie name in calling him as a witneſſe to confirme their vntruth, and as a patrone of their falſehood. They ſinne againſt their neighbour in abuſing him with a deceit of higheſt nature, namely, vnder the religious ſhew of an oath. And finally, they ſinne moſt fearfully againſt their owne ſoules, by their deſperate tempting of God, prouoking Gods iuſtice, truth, power, and terrible vengeance againſt themſelues, for their knowne wickedneſſe, and perfidious trecherie and periurie. On the other ſide, if knowing their oath to be wicked, they haue a purpoſe to performe it, then alſo they ſinne againſt God, in making him not only a Iudge and witneſſe, but alſo a ſuretie that they will performe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions, which hee abhorreth; and againſt their owne ſoules likewife, in that they binde themſelues vnto euill with an oath, and as though they were not prone enough of their owne accord to fall into wickedneſſe, they bring vpon them a neceſſitie of ſinning, and confirme themſelues in euill with the ſtrong obligation of an oath.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, an oath is vnlawfull and wicked in the proofe and euent, when as there lieth lurking in it ſome concealed wickedneſſe, which he that ſweareth doth not diſcerne. And this is of two kindes: firſt, when as the euill of the oath is really contained in the thing promiſed, which is not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered at the taking of the oath, but afterwards appeareth in the euent. Secondly, when as the thing which wee by oath promiſe, is in it owne nature good or indifferent, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards degenerateth and becommeth euill by accident. Of the former wee haue an example in <hi>Herod,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Mar. 6.</note> who by his raſh oath ſwore, though vnwittingly, the death of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt; and in thoſe who in our owne time ſweare themſelues vnto Monkiſh cloiſters in their ſuperſtitious deuotion and blind zeale: of the other, in thoſe who by oath vow virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſingle life, the which courſe of life might be lawfull or indifferent at the time when they tooke their oath, they hauing preſent continencie; but afterwards becommeth wicked and vnlawfull, when as burning in luſt they binde
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10736:34"/>themſelues to leade a ſingle life ſtill, and diſauow mariage which is the ordinance of God, and the meanes ordained by him to keepe and preſerue their veſſels in puritie and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                     <p>And this is the firſt kinde of vnlawfull oathes,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> Hovv an oath is vnlavvfull in reſpect of the partie vvho ſweareth.</note> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining wickedneſſe in themſelues bind not to performance. The ſecond is, when as the oath is vnlawfull in reſpect of the partie, who taketh it. As for example, when he that ſweareth wanteth diſcretion, and the vſe of naturall reaſon, as chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, fooles or mad men: or when thoſe who being vnder tuition and gouernment, binde themſelues by oath to doe a thing againſt the will and liking of their ſuperiours and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours. As when a childe ſweareth to match himſelfe in mariage againſt his parents will, whileſt he is vnder their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment; or ſweares himſelfe into a Monkiſh cloiſter, they diſavowing his courſe. For if vowes and religious oathes made vnto God, for the performance of ſome externall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, doe not binde the conſcience, but may be lawfully diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by ſuperiours and gouernours,<note place="margin">Numb. 30.4.6.30.</note> as appeareth Num. 30.4.6. then much more may ſuch oathes as are made vnto men be lawfully broken, when as they are vnlawfully made.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are the oathes which being vnlawfull doe not binde the conſcience,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> Vnlawful othes are to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> but may lawfully bee broken, either preſently when as they containe in them apparant euill at the firſt view, or as ſoone as the vnlawfulnes of them is diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which for a time hath been hidden from vs. Yea we not only may, as being permitted, but ought, as being required, breake all ſuch oathes, as binde vs to that which is wicked and vnlawfull. According to that:<note place="margin">Jſidorus.</note> 
                        <hi>In malis promiſſis reſcinde fidem, in turpi voto muta decretum: In euill promiſes keepe not fidelitie; in a diſhoneſt vow change thy purpoſe:</hi> for ſuch oathes as are vnlawfull are laudably broken, but damnably obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. And the reaſon is apparant, becauſe by keeping them we ſhall but adde ſinne vnto ſinne; vnto wicked ſwearing more wicked performance. Let vs therefore carefully take heede, that wee doe not by oath promiſe any thing which is euill; for if the euill bee knowne and apparant, it is horrible wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe to draw God into the aſſociation of our impietie,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10736:34"/>by calling him to be our witneſſe and ſurety; if it be not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant, it is prophane raſhneſſe; for before we ſweare, wee ought to bee aſſured of the lawfulneſſe of our oath. But if through infirmitie or corruption, we haue fallen into this ſinne, let vs hartilie repent for that which is paſt, and not continue in it by adding vnto vnlawfull ſwearing, vnlawfull performance; following herein the example of <hi>Dauid,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 25.</note> who reuerſed his ſinfull oath when by <hi>Abigaile</hi> he was conuinced of the vnlawfulnes thereof.</p>
                     <p>And thus haue I ſhewed that vnlawfull oathes doe not bind the conſcience.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6.</hi> Oathes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibilities doe not bind the conſcience.</note> The like may be ſaid of thoſe oathes which containe in them an impoſſibilitie of performance, as when we promiſe that which we haue no poſſible meanes to doe and performe, it being farre aboue our abilitie and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. Yea but will ſome ſay, we promiſe in baptiſme by oath,<note place="margin">Of our oath in Baptiſme.</note> that we will performe obedience vnto Gods law, the which is impoſſible for vs to performe; and therefore, either that oath is vaine, and needleſſe, or elſe we may lawfully ſweare vnto impoſſibilities. I anſwere, that in baptiſme, which is the Sacrament of the new couenant of grace, wee doe not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe exact performance of the Law, but Euangelicall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that we will hartilie deſire, and earneſtly indeuour with all our power, to yeeld that obedience which the law requireth; and that in vprightnes of our hearts, we will ſtriue and labour to walke in the way of Gods commandements; the which vow and promiſe euerie Chriſtian performeth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that meaſure of grace which he hath receiued. And howſoeuer it is not at all in our power to yeeld this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall obedience, yet this impoſſibilitie maketh not our oath vnlawfull, ſeeing the Lord himſelfe requireth this oath of vs, when we make the new couenant of grace, containing a mutual ſtipulation between God &amp; vs; wherein we promiſe faith, and obedience, and the Lord promiſeth his grace and holy ſpirit, whereby we are enabled to obey his will in ſome meaſure; and alſo the pardon of our ſins, and manifold imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, whereby we come farre ſhort of that exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which his law requireth, if we labouring vnder the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burthen of our ſinnes, doe ſtriue to ſhake them off by true
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10736:35"/>repentance, and faith in Chriſt. In which gratious promiſe of God we reſting and truſting, doe promiſe, not raſhly and vnaduiſedly, but in the aſſurance of faith, that which being impoſſible vnto vs, is made poſſible by Gods promiſed grace, and the aſſiſtance of his holy ſpirit: and therefore our oath in Baptiſme maketh nothing for the defence of thoſe, who not required by God, nor hauing any promiſe of his aſſiſtance to enable them to performe, doe raſhly and vpon their owne accord, promiſe impoſſibilities, in which number are they, who vow ſingle life.</p>
                     <p>Now this oath whereby we ſweare vnto impoſſibilities,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>7.</hi> Of that oath whereby we ſweare to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme knowne impoſſibilities.</note> is taken two waies; firſt, when as at the making of the oath the impoſſibilitie of performance appeared vnto vs, wee hauing no ſhew of any poſſible meanes to make good our promiſe; which who ſo doe, commit a fearefull ſinne againſt God, by forſwearing themſelues, wittingly, and willingly; by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his glorious name become a cloke for their falſhood; by tempting his truth and power, and daring his iuſtice to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his vengeance; ſo likewiſe, they ſinne againſt their neighbour, by abuſing and deceiuing him, in that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe that which they haue no poſſible meanes to performe, and againſt themſelues by prouoking Gods wrath, drawing downe vpon their guiltie heads his fearful vengeance, and by deſperate leaping into the fire of hell.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>8.</hi> Of impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the euent.</note> this oath is taken when the impoſſibilitie ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not, and that either becauſe we doe not aduiſedly conſider of our meanes to performe our promiſe; by reaſon whereof we doe not diſcerne our want of power, to make good our word; or hauing ſufficient power and meanes to performe our oath at the taking thereof, are afterwards diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by ſome vnexpected accident. As if by oath we ſhould promiſe to pay at a certaine time a ſumme of money, hauing ſo much in our owne cuſtodie; and before the appointed day came, ſhould be vtterly diſabled by fire, theeues, or ſome other caſualtie, ſo as we haue no poſſible meanes to performe our promiſe. The former cannot be excuſed, as being a ſinne of raſhneſſe and vnaduiſedneſſe (although it is much leſſe hainous then when we ſweare to knowne impoſſibilities) in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10736:35"/>that before we ſweare, we ſhould be aſſured, not onely of our will, but alſo of our power to performe our promiſe. The other is much more excuſeable, becauſe ſuch oathes ſeeme reuerſed by God himſelfe, who hath taken away from vs all meanes of performance. Howbeit, if in ſuch caſes wee would be wholly acquit from all imputation of fault, we are not to ſweare abſolutely, that we will performe our promiſe, ſeeing we haue no abſolute and vnlimited power, but to ioyne theſe conditions, If God will, if it pleaſe the Lord, if hee will ſuffer or inable me, and ſuch like. For if theſe conditions are to bee expreſſed or vnderſtood in our ordinarie promiſes, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth vs; then much more in ſuch promiſes;<note place="margin">Iam. 4.13.15.</note> as are of greateſt importance, being confirmed with a religious oath.</p>
                     <p>And thus haue I ſhewed that vnlawfull and impoſſible oathes binde not the conſcience.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>9.</hi> Where oathes made to our great loſſe and hindrance are to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</note> Now in the third place it may be demanded, whether wee are in conſcience bound to performe ſuch oathes, the performance whereof is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with great loſſe and hindrance. The which queſtion ſhall not need any large anſwere, ſeeing the holy Ghoſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe maketh it a marke of the childe of God, and inheritour of heauen, when as hee performeth his oath vnto his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and changeth not, for any loſſe or hindrance,<note place="margin">Pſal. 15.4.</note> which doth accompanie it. Though therefore we ſuſtaine neuer ſo much worldly loſſe and damage thereby, yet wee are to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our oathes, ſeeing by our periurie the glorie of God would be impeached, the aduancement whereof wee are to preferre before all the world.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>10.</hi> Whether ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted othes are to be obſerued.</note> it is demanded whether oathes extorted from vs by force and violence doe binde the conſcience. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if falling into the hands of theeues, wee be compelled vpon the perill of our liues to ſweare vnto them, that we will bring them ſuch a ſumme of money, and vſe ſecrecie, not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering them vnto any, by any meanes. I anſwere, that ſuch an oath containing nothing in it which is abſolutely euill doth binde the conſcience; and therfore is to be performed. Yea but this oath may ſeeme to be vnlawfull, firſt, becauſe we doe not take it willingly, but compelled. Secondly, becauſe
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10736:36"/>the giuing of money vnto a theefe, and keeping ſecrecie, doth make vs acceſſaries to his theft, in that wee helpe to maintaine him in his ill courſes, and thereby hurt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth by not diſcouering ſuch a pernicious member, that he may bee cut off; and alſo hazard other of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to fall into the like danger; and therefore the perill of our liues ſhould not make vs take ſuch an vnlawfull oath; or if through infirmitie wee haue taken it, wee are not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, becauſe it doth not binde the conſcience. To the former I anſwere, that howſoeuer wee doe not with abſolute conſent of will, take ſuch an oath, yet wee cannot be ſaid to haue ſworne vnwillingly, or againſt our wils; ſeeing we will it though not abſolutely and ſimply, yet accidentally, and conditionally, for the ſafegard of our liues, and for the auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of a greater euill. Euen as the Merchant doth willingly caſt his goods into the ſea in the ſtormie tempeſt, not ſimply, but conditionally, to preſerue the ſhip from a wracke, and himſelfe from drowning. To the other I anſwere, that by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his goods to a theefe he doth not maintaine him in his theft, nay rather being now furniſhed with ſome money to relieue his preſent neceſſitie, he may the better leaue his ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and betake himſelfe to liue by his honeſt labour. Or if the theefe be hereby incouraged to continue in his theft, yet he that giueth him the money is not acceſſarie to his fault, becauſe he doth not ioyne conſent of will nor approoue his theeuiſh courſes, neither yet doth intend any ſuch thing in his gift, but onely the ſafegard of his life. And therefore this continuance in theeuing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to paſſe, not ſimply through the gift of the true man, but accidentally by reaſon of the theeues corruption and maliciouſneſſe, who abuſeth it vnto ſinne. And whereas it is further obiected, that by ſwearing ſecrecie wee ſinne, becauſe wee hereby indamage the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and indanger our neighbours; to this I anſwer, that this commeth to paſſe not ſimply, through our ſecrecie, for he might ſurceaſe his robbing being concealed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a profitable member of the Common wealth; but if at all it happen, it is accidentally quite beſide our ſcope and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, through his owne corruption and maliciouſneſſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10736:36"/>who will not giue ouer his robbing. Againe, though it be a ſinne ſimply to indamage the Common-wealth, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our neighbours vnto danger; yet it is no ſinne, when in a leſſer damage is contained a greater benefit. Now by ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſecrecie wee preſerue our liues, who are profitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Common-wealth; and it is a greater benefit to the bodie to preſerue a ſound and good member, then to cut off ſuch a member as is vnſound and rotten. If indeede the queſtion were of treaſon againſt our Prince and countrie, then the obiection were of force, for as much as the ſafegard of the Prince and State is much more highly to bee valued then the preſeruing of our owne liues, who are but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members and priuate perſons; and therefore ſuch an oath being pernicious to our countrie, is not to be made to eſcape the danger of death; or if through infirmitie we ſhould yeeld vnto it, wee ought not to performe it, ſeeing it being vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full doth not binde the conſcience. But to returne to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer queſtion of concealing fellons, I adde further that by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing ſecrecie to ſaue our liues we ſhall not at all benefit the Common-wealth, ſeeing their diſcouerie hereby is rather hindred then furthered: for whileſt wee liue it only ſtandeth vpon the certaintie of our oath and reſolution, but being kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by them, it becommeth in reſpect of our reuealing plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſſible. And we after a ſort bring vpon the malefactor a kinde of wilfull neceſſitie of running into a more horrible ſinne then he intendeth: for where as if wee ſweare ſecrecie, he onely falleth into the ſinne of theft; by denying to keepe his counſell, wee vrge him vpon the perill of his owne life to commit the fearfull ſinne of murther, and to defile himſelfe with our innocent blood. Neither doe we expoſe our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour vnto the like perill, ſeeing by this ſecrecie wee intend not the danger of his life but the ſafegard of our owne; of which if for denying ſecrecie wee ſuffer our ſelues to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, he is neuer the more priuiledged from danger, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he is in greater perill, ſeeing the theefe who before only robbed, is now alſo fleſhed in blood. Finally, though it ſhould be granted, that through our ſecrecie our neighbour by accident ſhould bee indangered, yet this doth not make
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10736:37"/>our oath vnlawfull ſeeing we are to preferre the auoiding of our owne certaine death, before the ſecuring of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from vncertaine perill.</p>
                     <p>The fifth queſtion is like vnto the former,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>11.</hi> Whether oaths made through errour do bind the conſcience.</note> and therefore needeth no long anſwere, namely, whether oathes made through error, and wreſted from vs by deceit and fraud, doe binde the conſcience vnto performance. I anſwere briefly, that they do bind vs, if the things we promiſe by ſuch oathes be lawfull and in our power. A plaine example whereof wee haue in the oath which <hi>Ioſua</hi> and the Princes of Iſrael made vnto the Gibeonites,<note place="margin">Ioſ 9.9.15.18.</note> to the making wherof they were drawn by their ſubtiltie, quite againſt their purpoſe and meaning: which oath, for the reuerence of Gods glorious name, <hi>Ioſua,</hi> and the Princes performed, and afterwards being violated by <hi>Saul,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Sam. 21.1.8.</note> it was ſeuerely puniſhed by God with a grieuous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and the deſtruction of ſeuen of <hi>Sauls</hi> poſteritie.</p>
                     <p>The ſixth queſtion is,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>12.</hi> VVhether an oath made by the creatures or Idols bind the conſcience.</note> whether an oath made by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or by Idols and falſe gods bindeth the conſcience. To this I anſwere, that ſuch oathes bind the ſwearer to perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance. Concerning oathes, by the creatures it is apparant, ſeeing it is the queſtion which was betweene Chriſt and the Phariſes; for they held that ſuch oathes did not binde to performance, but our Sauiour affirmeth the contrarie, and yeeldeth this reaſon; becauſe they who ſweare by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſweare indirectly by God himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth. 5.34.35. and 23.21.</hi> Qei ſuper lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem ſalſum iurat periurus eſt, &amp;c. Non te audit lapis loquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſed punit Deus te fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentem. Tom. <hi>10.</hi> ſerm. <hi>28.</hi>

To the ſame purpoſe <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, that he who ſweareth falſly by a ſtone is periured; and that howſoeuer that is not holy by which hee ſweareth, yet the Lord is holy before whom he ſweareth; and therfore though the ſtone heareth him not ſpeake, yet God will puniſh him if he doe deceiue. To conclude, our ſimple promiſe would bind vs to performance, and therefore much more being confirmed by an oath</p>
                     <p>The like may bee ſaid of oathes made by Idols,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>13.</hi> Of oathes made by Idols and ſalſe gods.</note> and falſe gods; for howſoeuer it is vnlawfull to ſweare by them, yet whoſoeuer hath ſworne by them, as by true gods, he is bound
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10736:37"/>to performe his promiſe: not for the Idols ſake, but for Gods ſake before whom he ſweareth; not becauſe they are true gods indeed, but in that they are ſo in the ſwearers opinion; and therefore the Turke ſwearing by <hi>Mahomet,</hi> is periured, if he doe not performe his oath; and ſo likewiſe the Papiſts, ſwearing by the Idoll of the Maſſe.</p>
                     <p>The ſeuenth queſtion is, whether oathes made in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and companies, to maintaine their ſtatutes and orders,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>14.</hi> Of oathes made in ſocieties; and how farre forth they bind the conſcience.</note> doe bind the conſcience; and whether thoſe who ſweare to ſuch orders, are periured if they doe not obſerue them? To which I anſwere, that amongſt theſe ſtatutes there are ſome abſolute, requiring ſimple obedience; ſome penall and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall, requiring either performance, or ſubmiſſion to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe the mulct and puniſhment; ſome ſubſtantiall, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall, which are the fundamentall lawes and orders, vpon the performance whereof the good continuance and being of the corporation is grounded: which being obeyed, the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cietie is preſerued, but being broken and violated, it is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne and deſtroyed. Others are ceremoniall, tending onely to order, and decencie, and rather for ornament, then for neceſſitie. Now as the lawgiuers require ſimple and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute obedience vnto the former kind, namely, ſuch as are fundamentall, &amp; eſſentiall, and for the better performance of ſuch ſtatutes, require an oath of the whole ſocietie; ſo accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto their intention, the particular members of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration taking their oath, are bound to yeeld ſimple and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute obedience vnto ſuch ſtatutes, being not contrarie to the word of God, and if they do not, they are periured. But as the lawgiuers require not ſimple obedience vnto ſuch ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes as tend only to order &amp; comelines, but conditional, that they muſt obey or vndergoe the mulct; ſo they ſwearing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the lawgiuers intention, doe performe their oath in ſome manner, when they beare the penaltie for their non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>performance: although not as they ought, ſeeing the true end of lawes, is obedience, and not puniſhment; neuertheleſſe, they are hereby acquitted of periury, and in ſome caſes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſed, as when ſome neceſſarie and important cauſe mooueth them to omit a ceremoniall dutie.</p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:10736:38"/>
                     <p>The eighth queſtion is how othes are to be made and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>15.</hi> Oathes muſt be plainly made and ſimply per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</note> that wee may be cleere from periurie? Vnto which I anſwere, that we muſt both make and performe them ſimply and plainly without any manner of fraud and deceit, and in that ſenſe and meaning in which we would haue him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand vs vnto whom we ſweare, without either popiſh equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocation, or mentall reſeruation. For this were to abuſe the Maieſtie of God, if we make him a witneſſe and ſuretie of our deceit, and to delude our neighbour vnder the ſhew of a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious oath. But of the two it is more wicked and pernicious when this fraud and deceit is vſed in the making of an oath, then in the performance; for that moſt commonly proceeds from maliciouſneſſe and prepenſed falſehood, whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may be committed through frailtie and infirmitie; ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and vnaduiſedly.</p>
                     <p>Ninthly,<note place="margin">§.

The Papiſts affirme and maintaine we are not to keepe faith with heretiques; and therfore othes made to them are of no force to binde the conſcience. But if this opinion were receiued,<note place="margin">Concil.

We therefore maintaine and hold that all lawfull oathes doe bind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, vnto whomſoeuer they are made without reſpect of perſons, either friend or enemie, true profeſſor or heretique, Chriſtian or Turke, Proteſtant or Papiſt. Hauing herein for our examples the holie Patriarkes, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> who ſwore and performed their oathes made to idolatrous Infidels, <hi>Abimilech, Phicol</hi> and <hi>Laban.</hi> And conſequently that they who breake ſuch promiſes confirmed by oath, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſons.</p>
                     <p>In the tenth place it may bee demanded,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>17.</hi>
                        </note> whether any man
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10736:38"/>hath iuſt authoritie to diſpenſe with a lawful oath? I anſwer,<note place="margin">VVhether any man hath au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe vvith a lawfull oath.</note> that howſoeuer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> man of ſin, the Antichriſt of Rome herein matching himſelfe as equall with God, arrogateth this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to diſpenſe with lawfull oathes, and to free ſubiects from their ſworne allegiance vnto their lawfull Soueraigns; yet the truth is, that no mortall man hath this power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with an oath being lawfull, becauſe the Lord hath by his law bound vs vnto performance; for he hath charged vs not to take his name in vaine, and that wee ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare our ſelues, and by our periurie pollute his holy name;<note place="margin">Leuit. 19.12.</note> and who can countermand that which the Lord hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? and he hath conioyned our lawfull promiſes with the performance of them by the religious bond of an oath; who therefore can looſe that which God hath bound? who can ſeparate and put aſunder thoſe things which by his word he hath ioyned together? Whereof it plainly followeth, that our Ieſuits, Prieſts and other Papiſts, who hauing formerly taken the oath of allegiance, and ſworne to the ſupremacie of their lawfull Soueraigne, and afterwards reconcile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Pope, maintaine his ſupremacie, denie their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to their King, and ſo violate their former oath, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting to the Popes diſpenſation; are no better then periured perſous in the ſight of God and of all his faithfull ſeruants. Yea, but if a promiſe bee confirmed with an oath betweene man and man, may not he vnto whom the promiſe is made, and whom it onely concerneth, releaſe the other of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and ſo free him from his oath? I anſwer, that no man hath this authoritie; for in euery lawfull promiſſorie oath, the ſwearer obligeth himſelfe in a double bond, the one is from man to man, the other from man to God; now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee to whom the promiſe is made, may free the ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer from all claime and challenge of the promiſe made vnto him, ſo farre foorth as it lieth in his owne power; yet he hath no authoritie to free him from his oath, becauſe that is not only made vnto him, but alſo vnto God himſelfe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he only can diſpenſe with it. And hence it is that an oth made betweene man and man is called notwithſtanding the oath of the Lord,<note place="margin">Exod. 22.11. 2. Sam. 21.7.</note> becauſe thereby the ſwearer hath imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10736:39"/>bound himſelfe vnto God for the performance of his promiſe; and when hee doth performe it, hee is ſaid to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his oath, not ſo much vnto men, as vnto God himſelfe, as appeareth Matth. 5.33.<note place="margin">Matth. 5.13.</note> And herein conſiſteth a plaine dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene a ſingle promiſe, and a promiſe confirmed by an oath. A ſingle promiſe being only made vnto man, may be lawfully releaſed by his conſent vnto whom it is made: but a promiſe confirmed by oath cannot be reuerſed, becauſe it is not made to man alone, but to God alſo; who only hath authoritie to diſpenſe with ſuch oathes as are made vnto him.</p>
                     <p>In the laſt place it may bee demanded,<note place="margin">§.

I anſwere by diſtinction, that it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnlawfull for a priuate man to impoſe vpon ſuch a man an oath, for his owne gaine or priuate reſpect; becauſe wee are bound to preferre the glorie of God, which by ſuch an oath is impeached, and the ſaluation of our neighbours ſoule, which hereby is indangered, before any worldly gaine and aduantage. And conſequently wee ought rather to loſe any worldly benefit, then that by ſuch an oath we ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer God to be diſhonoured, and our neighbour to loſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

                        <hi>knowing that he will ſweare falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is worſe then a murtherer; becauſe a murtherer killeth but the bodie, this the ſoule, yea two ſoules at once; his whom hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh to ſweare, and his owne.

                     </p>
                     <p>But yet a Magiſtrate may lawfully put ſuch an one to his oath, if the execution of law and courſe of iuſtice doe ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.

Now in the ſecond part, I will briefly ſet downe ſome reaſons to diſſwade all men from this ſin, which is ſo diſhonorable to God, and ſo pernicious vnto mankind; all which I will reduce to theſe two heads; the firſt whereof is the hainouſnes of the ſinne; the ſecond is the grieuouſnes of the puniſhment, which doth accompanie it.</p>
                     <p>The hainouſnes will appeare both in it owne nature,<note place="margin">§.

That in it owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is a grieuous ſinne, may hereby be made manifeſt; firſt, becauſe it is odious and abominable, both in the ſight of God and men. That the Lord abhorreth this ſinne of periurie, it plainly appeareth, Zach. 8.17.<note place="margin">Zach. 8.17.</note> 
                        <hi>Let none of you imagine euill in your hearts againſt his neighbour, and loue no falſe oath: for all theſe are the things that I hate, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And hence it is that the Lord in his law hath ſo ſtraitly forbidden this ſinne.

                        <note place="margin">Leu. 19.12.</note> 
                        <hi>neither ſhalt thou defile the name of thy God.</hi> For the tranſgreſſion of which

                     <p>So alſo this is odious vnto men;<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2. 2.</hi> Periurie is odious vnto men.</note> and that not onely faithfull Chriſtians, amongſt whom a periured perſon loſeth the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of religion, and the true feare of God, yea euen of ciuilitie and common honeſtie; and is for euer branded with the blacke marke of a prophane perſon, who neuer after is to be credited in his words and deeds; but alſo vnto the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Turkes, and Pagans: for howſoeuer theſe men are but dimme ſighted in the morall duties of honeſtie betweene man and man, hauing onely the obſcure light of corrupted nature to be their guide, and euen almoſt ſtarke blind in the duties of pietie towards God; yet haue they abhorred this ſinne of periurie, and counted it worthie of the ſeuereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.

                     <p>Fourthly, it is a ſhamefull abuſe of Gods Maieſtie,<note place="margin">§.

For
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10736:41"/>what is this but deſperately to make triall whether God can or will according to his word puniſh their ſinne? What is it but like fierce bandogs to flie in Gods face, and to dare him to doe his worſt in the execution of his vengeance?</p>
                     <p>And theſe are the euils which are contained in this ſinne of periurie.<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>7.</hi> The euill fruits of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turie. <hi>1.</hi> They draw God into their ſinne as much as in them lieth.</note> Now the fruits and effects thereof are as bad, both in reſpect of God, our neighbour, and our ſelues. For firſt, the periured perſon exceedingly diſhonoureth Gods glorious Maieſtie, by drawing him, as much as in him lieth, into the communication of his ſinne, and offereth againſt him a kind of violence in forcing him to that which is quite contrary to his owne nature: for where as hee is moſt true, yea truth it ſelfe, they bring him as a patron of their vntruth and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and make him to the vttermoſt of their power, like vnto Satan who is the father of lies. And where as he is moſt iuſt, both in his word and workes, they bring him as their ſuretie to countenance their fraud and deceit. Whereby as in their impious maliciouſneſſe they doe, as much as in them lieth, deſtroy and ouerturne Gods nature and eſſence, and make him like vnto Satan; ſo doe they in deed, and in truth, make themſelues in this reſpect worſe then the diuell; for howſoeuer he is not onely a liar, but alſo the father of lies, euen from the beginning; yet wee neuer read nor heard that euer hee came to that deſperate audaciouſneſſe, that he durſt preſume to confirme his lies by an oath, or to abuſe Gods glorious name for the patronizing and countenancing his vntruthes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>8.</hi> Falſe ſwearing ouerthrovveth truth and iuſtice.</note> by his falſe ſwearing he ouerthroweth truth and iuſtice, the one being the Lords great Seale, the other the Scepter of his kingdome whereby hee ruleth amongſt men; the which hee doth after a moſt odious and trecherous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for he vſeth Gods forces againſt himſelfe; he ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth himſelfe with the helpe of Gods holy name, to deſtroy thoſe heauenly vertues, trueth and iuſtice, in which his ſoule delighteth; and for the vpholding and maintaining of thoſe helliſh vices of falſehood and iniuſtice, which he ſo much ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth.

He deſtroyeth the vſe and end of lawfull oathes, which is to determine controuerſies, and to put an end vnto all ſtrife; and conſequently taketh away the chiefe bond of peace; and preſerueth ſuſpitions, iealouſies, diſcord and contention, which weaken and diſſipate the beſt ſetled and moſt firmely eſtabliſhed gouernment; hee hereby peruerteth iudgement, cauſing the Iuries to giue a falſe verdict, and the Iudge an vniuſt ſentence, whereby innocencie is ſuppreſſed, the honeſt dealer ſpoiled of his right and brought vnto all extremities, falſehood maintained, the oppreſſor ſtrengthened in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious courſes; and in a word, the whole courſe and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of iuſtice peruerted and vtterly ouerthrowne.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd ſo much for thoſe reaſons which are taken from the greatneſſe of this ſinne. The ſecond ſort may be drawne from the grieuouſneſſe of their puniſhment; the which the Lord infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth either mediatly by the miniſterie of men, or immediatly by himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt men as it hath in all ages,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>1. 1.</hi> Periurie is puniſhed vvith ſhamefull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famie.</note> and in all places been accounted an hainous ſinne and capitall crime; ſo hath it been puniſhed with no light or ſmall puniſhments. For firſt, whereas a good name is better then either ſiluer, gold, or great riches,<note place="margin">Prou. 22.1.</note> and as highly valued amongſt vertuous men as life it ſelfe; this ſinne of periurie-hath euer ſo ſtained the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured perſon with ſuch a deepe ingrained die of infamie and reproch, that the blemiſh could neuer bee taken away vnto the end of life. And howſoeuer the offender hauing waſhed and bathed his cheekes with teares of vnfained repentance, and his ſoule with the blood of Chriſt, applied by a liuely faith, hath the polluted ſtaines of this defiling ſinne waſhed away out of Gods ſight; yet ſeldome is hee ſo purged and cleanſed in the iudgement of men, but that ſome blots and blemiſhes doe ſtill remaine euen to the end of life. To this purpoſe <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2.</hi> de legib.</note> 
                        <hi>Periurij poena diuina, exitium; humana, dedecus:</hi> Diuine puniſhment inflicted vpon periured perſons for their falſe ſwearing is deſtruction; humane, is ſhame and diſcredit. And this is that puniſhment which both the Ciuill and Canon law impoſed vpon ſuch; namely, that if they were taken with this fault, they ſhould for euer bee ſo diſabled in their credit and reputation, that they might not be admitted to be witneſſes, and to giue teſtimonie, either in their owne or other mens cauſes, in any iudicial proceedings. The which puniſhment was in Gods righteous iudgement inflicted in ſome proportion according to the qualitie of their ſinne: for whereas they to grace themſelues in their vntruths, care not
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10736:42"/>(as much as in them lieth) to diſhonour God, by deriuing the imputation of fraud and deceit vpon him whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate as a witneſſe of their lies: God iuſtly meeteth with them, and returneth the infamie and reproch vpon their owne heads.</p>
                     <p>Beſides which puniſhment of infamie,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>2.</hi> Other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of periurie.</note> the ſame lawes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe others vpon him that commits this ſin, as that he ſhall be depriued of all Eccleſiaſticall preferments, and dignities, if he poſſeſſe them, and not be admitted, either into the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie or gouernment of the Church. That likewiſe he ſhall be diſpoiled of all ciuill aduancement, ſo as he ſhall not bee admitted vnto any ſuch preferment, nor reentred after he is diſplaced. Beſides which puniſhments in name and ſtate, they determine that he ſhould be puniſhed as a common coſener, and be either beaten with cudgels and ſtaues, or exiled and baniſhed; or if it were in capitall matters, and concerned the life of his neighbour, he ſhould be puniſhed with death it ſelfe, according to the law of God in that caſe prouided: Deut. 19.19. The which puniſhment of death was inflicted vpon all among the Egyptians,<note place="margin">Patric. lib. <hi>5.</hi> tit. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> who were conuicted of wilful periurie, vpon any cauſe whatſoeuer, as <hi>Patricius</hi> recordeth.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe theſe humane puniſhments are not alwaies inflicted vpon the offenders,<note place="margin">§.

And becauſe his glory which is by this ſin impeached, is moſt deare vnto him: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord doth ſeuerely puniſh thoſe who thus offend, both with temporarie, and eternall puniſhments; in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; and alſo in their poſteritie, as the Poet well obſerued:</p>

                     <p>And as this ſin of periurie is in an extraordinarie ſort abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in Gods ſight; ſo doth he puniſh it with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10736:43"/>plagues, and beſides thoſe vſuall puniſhments, which are common to all offenders; he hath inflicted vpon periured perſons ſuch fearefull iudgements from time to time, which haue been ſo fitte and proportionable to the ſinne, that one might reade their offence written in their puniſhment, as it were in great text letters ſet ouer their heads. And thus did the Lord puniſh the breach of the couenant made with the Gibeonites, and confirmed by oath, with three yeeres fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and with the death of ſeuen of <hi>Sauls</hi> poſteritie, who had violated this oath;<note place="margin">2. Sam. 21.</note> and that not in a ſecret manner, but openly declaring what was the ſinne for which hee inflicted theſe puniſhments. So becauſe <hi>Zedechia</hi> broke the oath of the Lord, which hee had made vnto <hi>Nebucadnezer,</hi> hee had his ſonnes ſlaine before his face, and that hee might neuer behold cauſe of comfort after this ſad ſpectacle, his eyes were preſently put out, and he being bound with chaines was led captiue vnto Babylon, where he ſlauiſhly liued, and died wretchedly: all which puniſhments were inflicted vpon him principally for his periurie,<note place="margin">Ezech. 17.15.</note> as appeareth, Ezech. 17.15.16.18.19.</p>
                     <p>Beſides which temporall puniſhments, the Lord inflicteth vpon ſuch as thus offend,<note place="margin">§.

And after this life, if the flame of Gods wrath in the meane while be not quenched with the teares of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained repentance, it ſhall burne hot againſt him, kindling and preparing for him the fire of hell, in which he ſhall bee eternally tormented; for if the liar hath his portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death,<note place="margin">Apoc. 21.8.</note> as it is Apoc. 21.8, then much more the periured perſon (who confirmeth his lies by an oath, calling God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be, not onely a witneſſe and ſuretie but alſo a Iudge to auenge his falſhood) ſhall with the intollerable waight of this outragious ſinne, be ſuncke into the deepeſt bottome of this helliſh condemnation.</p>

                     <p>And thus haue I ſhewed the lawfull vſe of an oath,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> The concluſion of this treatiſe.</note> and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo how it is abuſed both by vaine ſwearing and impious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing: and withall haue propounded many reaſons and arguments, which may ſerue as wholſome preſeruatiues to keepe thoſe who haue any feare of God from falling into theſe ſinnes; or as profitable medicines to cure them of theſe dangerous diſeaſes of the ſoule, if alreadie they haue ſeazed on them. Now as I heartily pray vnto God that all who ſhall reade this treatiſe, and all other who profeſſe the name of Chriſt, may by theſe and ſuch like reaſons made effectuall by his grace, and powerfull working of his holie Spirit, bee brought both to a forſaking and alſo to an vtter hatred and deteſtation of theſe ſinnes; ſo with all humble earneſtneſſe I intreate our Magiſtrates and Gouernours, who are as Gods deputies and Lieutenants ſet amongſt vs, to execute his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous iudgements; that they will in feruent zeale to Gods glorie, whoſe perſon they doe ſuſtaine, as being pettie gods vpon earth; not onely carefully reforme themſelues of theſe vices, whereby Gods holie name is polluted, both in their owne particular, and as they are examples vnto others; but alſo that they would wiſely enact and diligently execute ſuch wholſome lawes, as may reſtraine, or ſeuerely puniſh theſe groſſe abuſes, of vaine ſwearing, and impious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing, which in theſe times ſo commonly raigne amongſt vs. That hereby they may ſhew and approne themſelues tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious, in that they are carefull, not only to ſuppreſſe ſuch abuſes and ſins as tend to the hurt of their countrie and Common-wealth, or to the damage and hindrance of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſubiects (for ſo ſhould they go no further the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue ciuill policie for their guide, &amp; Heathen Magiſtrates for their examples, and conſequently bring vpon their religion the imputation of a meere policie, as being both inlarged and bounded with the ſame libertie and limits:) but alſo by ſhewing the like care and zeale in ſuppreſſing and puniſhing thoſe ſinnes of impietie againſt the firſt table, which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly committed againſt the Maieſtie of God himſelfe, of which nature is idolatrie and ſuperſtition, vaine ſwearing, curſing, and periurie, prophanation of Gods Sabbaths and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10736:44"/>ſuch like. And ſo ſhall they moue the Lord in mercie to look vpon vs, to put vp his ſword of vengeance which hath been long drawne againſt vs, and to pull backe his puniſhing hand which a great while hath lien heauie vpon our land, by vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall ſickneſſe, peſtilence and famine: and contrariwiſe to ſtretch foorth his hand of mercie and goodneſſe; whereby his bleſſings and bountifull benefits ſhall be not only conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, but alſo inlarged and increaſed both vnto vs and our poſteritie. So alſo ſhall they gather vnto themſelues certaine aſſurance,<note place="margin">1.

The which mercie the Lord our God vouchſafe for his Sonne our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt his ſake, to whom with the holy Spirit, three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and one God, infinite in all perfection, be aſcribed all honour and glorie both now and euermore.

Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the man of God being inabled by other gifts and graces, as learning, zeale, pietie and the reſt, for the worke of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, is fitted to vſe theſe his abilities to his beſt aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which otherwiſe would bee vnprofitable, and often times rather hinder then further the end of his labours. For the Miniſter of God is the Lords ſpirituall watchman, and therefore it is not enough for him to ſit in the watch-tower, and to deſcrie all commers, but hee muſt haue ſpirituall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to diſcerne friends from enemies, and of enemies, which are to bee contemned as weake and impotent, and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10736:45"/>which to be incountred, as being dangerous and pernicious. He is the ſpirituall Phyſition of the Church, and therefore he muſt not onely haue skill to make good medicines, but alſo ſpirituall wiſedome to fit theſe medicines according to the nature and qualitie of his patients diſeaſes. He is the Steward of the familie, and therefore he muſt not only haue a liberall hand, to giue food to all his fellow ſeruants, but he muſt alſo diſcreetly diſtribute vnto euery one their portion in fit time and ſeaſon. He is the Lords Gardener; and therefore he muſt not only haue knowledge to diſcerne betweene flowers and weedes, but alſo diſcretion to diſtinguiſh of times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when it is fit to pull vp the weedes or to let them grow; otherwiſe he ſhall either pull vp the flowers with the weeds, or leauing the roote behinde ſpend his labour in vaine. In a word, he is Gods Oratour and Ambaſſadour vnto his people, and therefore hee muſt not onely be furniſhed with wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, but alſo he muſt haue ſpirituall wiſedome and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to deliuer his meſſage in ſeaſon, and to haue reſpect vnto circumſtances, of time, occaſion, perſons and place. And this is that ſpeech which the Wiſe man ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, Prou. 25.11.<note place="margin">Prou. 25.11.</note> 
                        <hi>A word ſpoken in his place, or fitly and in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is like apples of gold and pictures of ſiluer:</hi> that is, precious and delightfull, ſweete and profitable. It is not therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for the well diſcharging of the worke of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, that we are able to ſpeake a word of comfort; vnleſſe we haue diſcretion to vtter it in time of neede, for the raiſing vp of thoſe who are caſt downe; and for the refreſhing of the faint and wearie: for this were nothing elſe but to giue a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a healthie man, and to lay a ſoueraigne plaiſter vpon the whole skinne. It is not enough that we are <hi>Bonarges,</hi> the ſonnes of Thunder, to bruiſe and batter ſtonie hearts, and beate downe ſinne by denouncing Gods fearfull iudgments; if we doe not applie our ſpeech to perſons and times, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigh againſt thoſe ſins with which the people vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſpeake are moſt tainted and corrupted.<note place="margin">The ſinnes of the times ought to be reproued.</note> For if ſpeaking to the people we declaime againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſins of the Magiſtrates, or prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to Engliſhmen, we inueigh againſt the peculiar ſins of the Turkes or Indians; or reprehend prodigalitie among the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10736:45"/>couetous, or pride amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the ſordidous, or ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the prophane and irreligious; this is not to reprooue, but to backbite ſinne; to fight valiantly in the abſence of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and with a ſtrong arme to beate the aire, and to contend againſt a ſhadow; which may ſpraine a ioynt, and for reward mooue ſcornefull laughter, rather then admiration of any true valor; yea in truth this is nothing elſe but to nouriſh vice with the milke of vertue, by religious reproofes to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then men in their ſins, and to make them flatter themſelues with a conceit that they are ſufficiently vertuous, when they are not alike vicious to other men; and to lie ſecurely wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in thoſe ſinnes which are extreme and contrarie to thoſe which are reprooued. The conſideration whereof, made mee, who am bound in conſcience of my calling to ſpeake and write againſt ſinne and wickedneſſe, to ponder with my ſelfe what ſinnes were moſt fit to be ſpoken againſt, as needing in our times and countrie moſt reproofe: and after ſome deliberation, I reſolued to inueigh againſt that beaſtly ſinne of reaſonable creatures, the ſinne of drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that as much as in me lieth I may diſſwade all men from this vice, which darkeneth the light, both of nature &amp; grace, bringeth vpon the eye of the vnderſtanding, a temporarie blindneſſe, and ſo yeelds men ouer vnto Satan to be led as it were blindfold into all manner of ſinne and wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>In which argument I hope I ſhall not ſpend my time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitably,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>2.</hi> Drunkennes aboundeth in our land.</note> ſeeing in our daies this vice more raigneth then euer it did in former ages; as may appeare in that our wiſe Stateſmen thought it neceſſarie in Parliament, to inact a law for the ſuppreſſing of this ſinne; for, <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae naſcuntur leges;</hi> euill manners occaſion good lawes. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed not without good cauſe, is the ſword of the Magiſtrate ioyned with the ſword of the ſpirit, ſeeing now this vice is growne to ſuch ſtrength, that it is to be feared it will not in haſte, by both be repreſſed. For who ſeeth not that many of our people of late, are ſo vnmeaſurablie addicted to this vice, that they ſeem to contend with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Germanes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greateſt part of their time in carouſing, as though they did not drinke to liue, but liued to drinke: or as if from men
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10736:46"/>they were transformed into flies which liue whollie by ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Neither is it poſſible that euer the appetite of theſe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould be ſatisfied, ſeeing they haue an hundred deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to make it ſtill inſatiable; they drinke not onely for thirſt and delight, but alſo for companie and good fellowſhip, one drawing on another when his appetite faileth; they drinke in brauerie, thinking it no ſmall credit to him, who can get the victorie in this drunken conflict. In this helliſh conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they vſe, as I haue heard, for I thanke God he hath kept my eies from beholding this wickedneſſe; they vſe, I ſay, glaſſes without feete, that ſo they may goe about in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion; they carrouſe by the bell, by the dye, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, the yard, and ſo by meaſure, drinke out of meaſure. They draw one another to exceſſiue quaffing, by making challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who can expreſſe moſt loue to their abſent friends by largeſt drinking, not caring to bring themſelues, through their intemperancie into grieuous diſeaſes, by drinking healthes to other men. And becauſe nature is content with a little, and ſoone cloyed and oppreſſed with exceſſe, they vſe all their art and skill to ſtrengthen it for theſe wicked ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploites, as though their naturall corruptions would not preſſe them deepe enough into hell, vnleſſe they alſo loaded them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with artificiall wickedneſſe. To this purpoſe they vſe all ſorts of ſalt meates to whet their appetite, manie whereof were found out by wantonneſſe, and not neceſſitie; to this end they vſe tobacco, that by drunkenneſſe they may expell drunkenneſſe, and being glutted with wine, they drinke ſmoke, that by this varietie it may not grow tedious.</p>
                     <p>And therefore it is more then time,<note place="margin">§.

To which purpoſe I thought good to incounter this vice with the ſword of the ſpirit, and to lay open the nakedneſſe, and vglie

                     <p>Firſt then the drunkard grieuouſlie ſinneth againſt God, and that in diuers reſpects.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2. 1.</hi> The drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. <hi>Phil. 3.19.</hi>

Wherof it is that gluttons and drunkards are vſually called bellie-gods, becauſe they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loue it, and more diligently ſerue it, and more carefully pleaſe it, then God himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> Drunkennes maketh men vnfit for Gods ſeruice.</note> therby they doe ſo oppreſſe the heart, loade the ſtomacke, and dull the ſpirits, that they are altogether vnfit to performe vnto God any part of his worſhip and ſeruice; for if the Lord will be worſhipped in ſpirit and truth, how farre are they from worſhipping God aright, who haue not ſo much as the vſe of their reaſon and vnderſtanding? If more then accuſtomed ſobrietie, yea ſometimes faſting and totall abſtinence, be required when we powre forth our ſoules vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God in prayer, that wee may be the better fitted for this holy action; how ill are they diſpoſed for this exerciſe, whoſe ſtomackes are ſurcharged, and braines diſtempered, with wine and ſtrong drinke? If ſuch bee our weakeneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, that when we come faſting to the hearing of the word, we are often ouertaken with drowſie dulneſſe; what can be expected of thoſe whoſe heads are intoxicated with fumes and drunken vapours, but blockiſh deadneſſe, and more then brutiſh drowſineſſe? The conſideration whereof ſhould make all Chriſtians abhorre this vice: for if it bee eſteemed an odious thing that a ſubiect, being to conferre with his Prince about important affaires, ſhould come vnto him in his drunkennes; how abominable is his practiſe, who being to come into Gods preſence, either to ſpeake vnto him by prayer, or to heare the Lord ſpeaking vnto him in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the word, is ſo oppreſſed with drinke, that hee is more fit to ſleepe then to heare, or ſpeake, and to diſgorge
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10736:49"/>his ſtomack, then to powre forth his ſoule before God? Now theſe actions are not ſeldome to be performed,<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.17.</note> but they muſt be the Chriſtians continuall exerciſe; and therefore that hee may the better performe them, he muſt obſerue continuall temperance and ſobrietie.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4. 3.</hi> They greſly abuſe Gods creatures.</note> they ſinne againſt God in the vngratefull abuſe of his creatures; for whereas the Lord hath allowed vnto them a large portion, and beſtowed vpon them his gifts, with a bountiful hand, to the end that hereby he may mooue them to loue, ſerue, and praiſe him, with greater cheerefulneſſe; they contrariwiſe abuſe theſe benefits to ſurfetting and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, whereby they diſhonour God, deſtroy their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, whollie diſable themſelues for Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and are altogether fitted for the ſeruice of ſinne and Satan.

According to that of the Poet: <hi>Arca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num demens detegit ebrietas.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Virgil. de vin. &amp; ven.</note> For as his exceſſiue drinking will not ſuffer him to keepe his meate in his ſtomacke, ſo neither will it ſuffer him to keepe a ſecret in his minde. Neither is it any great wonder that he is thus iniurious to others, ſeeing he offreth as great wrong to himſelf, being not able amongſt his cups to keepe his owne counſell, in matters which moſt neerely concerne him: for as it is well ſaid,<note place="margin">Plutarch. mor. vol. <hi>2.</hi> de Garr.</note> That which is in the heart of a ſober man, is in the tongue of a drunkard.

                     <p>And thus the drunkard ſinneth againſt all men;<note place="margin">The drunkard ſinneth againſt the poore.</note> but more ſpecially he ſinneth againſt the poore, in that by his great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in exceſſiue drinking, hee hath not wherewith to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue them, and ſo robbeth them of their due allowance: for his ſuperfluitie was not giuen him of God that hee ſhould conſume it in riotous tipling, but that he ſhould giue drinke to the poore thirſtie, and bread to the hungrie.</p>
                     <p>But as hee that is addicted to drunkenneſſe is bad abroad,<note place="margin">§.

For when he is abroad he maketh hauock of al, he conſumeth that allowance which belongeth to the whole houſehold, hee ſwalloweth downe his wiues portion, and childrens patrimonies, yea whileſt he pampereth himſelfe he defraudeth their bellies, and out of their penurie and want he maintaineth his owne ſuperfluous exceſſe. And yet better it were hee ſhould ſtay ſtill abroad, then by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming home trouble the whole famile: for if hee be able to ſpeake, he ſpendeth his time in ſcolding and railing, or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue ribauldrie; if he be able to moue, he either fighteth and brauleth with thoſe who are about him; or if he be poſſeſſed with a more gameſome furie, hee vſeth ſuch apiſh geſtures, and ridiculous behauiour, as that ſometimes hee extorteth from his beſt friends a wofull ſmile, and prouoketh laughter from heauie hearts. So that as the drunkard when hee is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad plaieth the theefe, in robbing all of their due who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him, ſo at his comming home he ſheweth himſelf, either a lion or an ape, a tyrant or a foole; that I may ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his ſluttiſh filthineſſe, whereby he maketh himſelfe loathſome to his neereſt and deareſt friends; of which the Prophet plainly ſpeaketh,<note place="margin">Eſa. 28.8.</note> Eſa. 28.8.</p>

And as his bellie is an vnſatiable graue to burie his drinke, ſo his drinke is as it were a graue wherein he is buried; in regard whereof one truly ſaith,<note place="margin">Auguſt. lib. de Poenit.</note> that <hi>ebrioſus quum abſorbet vinum, abſorbetur à vino:</hi> Whileſt the drunkard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth wine, he is deuoured of wine, ſeeing nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of a man but a ſenſeleſſe trunck and filthie carcaſe.

Firſt ſinne is committed, then practiſed, and often practiſe bringeth cuſtome, and cuſtome becommeth a ſecond nature, and hath in it the force of a law which muſt be obeyed, not in courteſie, but vpon neceſſitie. And as this is true of all ſins in generall; ſo eſpecially it is verified in this ſinne of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe; for firſt men drinke for thirſt, then for delight, then for wantonneſſe, and ſo by much bibbing they bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10736:53"/>to ſuch an vnſatiable thirſt, that they cannot ſit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the cup at their elbow.</p>

Sect. <hi>4.</hi> The drunkard maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vvorſe then a beaſt.</note> where as man by creation is the moſt excellent of all the creatures, being created according to Gods owne image, by this vice hee maketh himſelfe equall with the beaſts, for he is depriued thereby, not onely of pietie, but of humanitie, euen of his vnderſtanding and reaſon, wherein hee differeth from a beaſt farre more then in his outward ſhape; yea in truth in diuers reſpects he maketh himſelfe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the brutiſh creatures, for he much more degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth from the excellencie of his creation; hee depriueth himſelfe, not onely of the vſe of his reaſon, but alſo of his ſenſes, not of his vnderſtanding alone, but of his ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and motion alſo; for when he ſtandeth, he is readie to fall, and when he mooueth, he reeleth and ſtaggereth. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is farre more intemperate then almoſt any beaſt; for when they haue eaten ſufficient, they will eate no more, and when they haue drunke to quench their thirſt, and to ſatisfie nature, they cannot bee forced by any violence to drinke againe; whereas theſe tiplers drinke double and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble more then they neede, and not onely ſatisfie nature, but alſo glut and oppreſſe it with ſuperfluitie.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> Drunkenneſſe bringeth po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie.</note> this ſinne bringeth men to pouertie and want, for they conſume their wealth at the wine, and ſwallow downe their whole eſtate, and ſo it commeth to paſſe, that hauing ſpent all in ſuperfluities, in the end they want neceſſaries, and becauſe in their youth they will drinke nothing but wine, they are oftentimes conſtrained in their old age to drinke water. So it is ſaid, Prou. 21.17. <hi>He that loueth paſtime ſhall be but a poore man, and he that loueth wine and oyle ſhall not be rich.</hi> And Pro. 23.21.<note place="margin">Pro. 21.17.23.21.</note> 
                        <hi>The drunkard and the glutton ſhal be poore, and the ſleeper ſhall be clothed with rags.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And theſe,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6.</hi> The drunkard ſinneth againſt his ſeuerall parts, and firſt againſt his ſoule.</note> with many more euils, this vice bringeth to the whole man. Beſides which common miſchiefes it is alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious to his ſeuerall parts: for firſt it infatuateth the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, peruerteth the will, and corrupteth all the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. To this purpoſe one ſaith: <hi>Vbi regnat ebrietas ratio exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat, intellectus obtunditur, conſilia deuiant, iudicia ſubuertuntur:</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:10736:53"/>Where drunkenneſſe raigneth as King, there reaſon is bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed as an exile, the vnderſtanding is dulled, counſell wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth, and iudgement is ouerthrowne. With this accordeth <hi>Seneca</hi> his definition of drunkenneſſe: <hi>Nihil aliud eſt ebrietas quàm voluntaria inſania:</hi> Drunkenneſſe is nothing elſe but a voluntarie madneſſe: <hi>Extende in plures dies illum ebrium habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, nunquid de furore dubitabis?</hi> If this drunken habite bee continued for many daies together, who would make any doubt but that the partie were out of his wits? <hi>Nunc quoque non eſt minor, ſed breuior:</hi> But take it as it is, and it is no leſſe madneſſe then frenzie, but only ſhorter. Although then drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe be not direct madneſſe, yet to ſpeake the beſt, it is a temporarie forfeiture of the wits; and in this it muſt needes be confeſſed to be worſe then frenzie, in that this is violent, that voluntarie; this the euill of puniſhment, but that the euill of ſinne. Yea this vice doth not only rob men of reaſon, but alſo of common ſenſe, ſo as they can neither preuent future danger, nor feele preſent ſmart. And this the Wiſe man in liuely manner expreſſeth, Prou. 23.24. where hee ſaith,<note place="margin">Prou. 23.34.35</note> that <hi>the drunkard ſhall be as one that ſleepeth in the middeſt of the ſea, and as he that ſleepeth in the top of the maſt.</hi> 35. <hi>They haue ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken me, ſhall he ſay, but I was not ſicke; they haue beaten me, but I knew not when I awoke: therefore I will ſeeke it yet ſtill.</hi> A no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table example hereof wee haue in <hi>Lot,</hi> who was ſo beſotted with drinke, and depriued of ſenſe and reaſon, that vnwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly he committed inceſt with his owne daughters,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.35.</note> neither knowing when they lay downe, nor when they roſe vp. So that whileſt drunkenneſſe laſteth it hath the ſame operation with deadly poiſon; for it intoxicateth the braine, benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the ſenſes, infeebleth the ioints and ſinewes, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man into a temporarie lethargie. Hence it is that <hi>Cyrus</hi> in his childhood being asked by his grandfather <hi>Aſtiages,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Xenoph. in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia Cyri. lib. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> why at the feaſt hee did not drinke wine; returned this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere full of wittie ſimplicitie; Becauſe (ſaid he) I tooke it to bee poiſon: for at the laſt feaſt I obſerued that thoſe who drunke of it, were ſoone after depriued of their vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſenſes. Whereby appeareth the odiouſneſſe of this ſinne: for if it bee a hatefull thing for a man to wound his
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10736:54"/>owne fleſh, and wilfully to maime the members of his bodie; how abominable is it to wound the minde it ſelfe, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer violence againſt our reaſon and vnderſtanding? If it be a crime to offer violence againſt the ſubiects, then ſurely to lay violent hands vpon the King himſelfe, and to pull him out of his regall throne, muſt needes be condemned as outragious wickedneſſe.</p>
                     <p>And thus the drunkard ſinneth againſt his owne ſoule.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>7.</hi> How the drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard ſinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his body: <hi>1.</hi> by defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it.

Neither is there almoſt any part of the bodie which is not diſordered and deformed with this vice of drunkenneſſe; their eyes become red, their face is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, their breath noiſome, their ſpeech ſtammering, their bodies ſtaggering, their geſtures apiſh, and all their actions fooliſh. And hence it was that the Lacedemonians vſed to ſhew vnto their children their Helots and ſlaues in the time of their drunkenneſſe, thinking that their vgly deformitie both in bodie and minde would be an effectuall argument to make them lothe this vice, which euen at the firſt view ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo odious.</p>

For as the earth it ſelfe with too much moiſture is turned into bogges and quagmires; ſo alſo is the bodie thereby wholly corrupted, and (through the redundance of humours, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall heate being extinguiſhed) is brought vnto grieuous diſeaſes, as dropſies, gouts, palſies, apoplexie, and ſuch like.

As therefore ſobrietie and temperance is the beſt nurſe to preſerue health and continue ſtrength; ſo drunkenneſſe, exceſſe and ſurfetting are the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieſt meanes to ouerthrow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the readieſt way which a

                     <p>Laſtly, it ſhortneth the life and bringeth vntimely death.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>9.</hi> Drunkenneſſe ſhorteneth the life and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth vntimely death.</note> For to ſay nothing of thoſe dangers vnto which they expoſe themſelues, by quarelling and brauling in the time of their drunkennes, in which many haue periſhed, and to paſſe them ouer who hauing loſt the ſterne of reaſon, wherewith they ſhould guide themſelues, haue as it were daſhed againſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie accidents, and ſo made ſhipwrack of their liues; ſome on the land, ſome in the water, ſome in the ſtreetes, and ſome in the ditches; how many are there who haue drunke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues dead, and haue preſently died, with the weapon as it were in their bellie? ſo that there needed not any Iurie to go vpon them, to finde out the cauſe of their death, it being no more ſudden, then the cauſe apparant. Whoſe deaths charitie it ſelfe muſt needes iudge moſt miſerable, ſeeing they die in their ſins, and are taken away in Gods iuſt wrath, euen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they are ſacrificing their ſoules vnto Satan. But yet ſmall is the number of thoſe who periſh in this apoplexie of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, in compariſon of thoſe multitudes whom it ling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gringly conſumeth; for it doth by little and little quench the naturall heate, and drowne the vitall ſpirits, and ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth men though not by ſo direct a paſſage, yet but a little way about to their graues, as certainly though not ſo ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For it bringeth cruditie to the ſtomacke, and ach to the head, rheumes, impoſtumes, gouts, conſumptions, apoplexies, whereof men periſh: and ſo howſoeuer drunkenneſſe is not the mother, yet it is the grandmother of their death, though men are aſhamed (like vpſtarts in our times) that it ſhould deriue it pedigree ſo farre, for ſo baſe a kinred, &amp; therfore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title it after the name of the next parent.

It is true alſo that the mother earth is infeebled with much bearing, and hath her ſtrength much abated with ſo innumerable child-birthes, and being now come to her cold melancholie age, cannot bring forth her fruites ſo full of vertue and ſtrength, and ſo fit for the nouriſhment of our bodies, as ſhee did in former times; but that there ſhould be ſuch a change ſo ſuddaine and ſo extraordinarie, and that there ſhould be ſuch great difference in health, and ſtrength, and long life, betweene this our age, and that which went next before; it can be imputed vnto nothing more then this, that now drunkenneſſe and intemperance is after an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie manner increaſed, whereby the naturall and vitall heate of men is drowned and extinguiſhed, before it bee neere ſpent, like a candle caſt into the water, before it bee halfe burned. If then wee thinke it a fearefull ſinne for a man to murther himſelfe, and by laying violent hands on his owne perſon to ſhorten his life; then let vs not eſteeme drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe as a ſmall offence, ſeeing it produceth the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, though by other meanes and inſtruments, and brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth our bodies to the ſame vntimely death, although it bee by a diuers way.</p>
                     <p>And theſe are the temporall euils which the drunkard bringeth vpon himſelfe,<note place="margin">§.

For firſt by this ſinne he excludeth himſelfe out of the number of thoſe children who are borne vnto God by regeneration and new birth, and is ſeparated from Ieſus Chriſt, ſo as he hath no communion with him nor part in his benefits; for thoſe who are regenerate are begotten vnto God by his ſpirit dwelling in them, and where the ſpirit of God dwelleth, there it ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth it ſelfe, both by mortifying the old man, and ſubduing the luſts of the fleſh, and by quickening the new man, and bringing forth the fruites of the ſpirit.

                     <p>Neither are they in Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeing they walke not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſpirit, but after the fleſh; they haue not as yet put on Chriſt, ſeeing they haue not put off drunkenneſſe, for he will not be our garment wherein being clothed, we may appeare glorious and righteons in Gods ſight, before we caſt away from vs the filthie ragges of the fleſh; and therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth vs, firſt to giue a finall farewell to gluttonie and drunkenneſſe, chambering and wantonnes, ſtrife and enuying, caſting them from vs as polluted ragges, which are not worth our wearing, and then to take vnto vs Ieſus Chriſt, and put him on as our wedding garment with the hand of faith.

                        <hi>A man that refraineth not his appetite, is like a Citie which is broken downe and without walles.</hi> Yea euen the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man <hi>Crates,</hi> diſcerned this by the light of nature: for ſeeing a young man growne fat and purſie, with pampering his bellie, he cried out vnto him, <hi>O miſer, aeſine aduerſus te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſum carcerem munire:</hi> O wretch, leaue off to ſtrengthen thy priſon againſt thy ſelfe. But this follie will appeare to bee ſo much greater, if we further conſider our owne weakeneſſe, and the ſtrength of our enemie; for if he be ſo mightie that we hardly obtaine the victorie when we are armed at all points with the Chriſtian armour, and haue done our beſt indeuour to weaken him by withdrawing his foode, and munition, by faſting and watchfulneſſe; what can we expect but a ſhamefull ouerthrow, when wee haue not onely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed our ſelues of the ſpirituall armour, and ſo are left na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but alſo haue hartned our enemie with ſtore of foode, and armed him at all points againſt our ſelues? A notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample hereof we haue in <hi>Lot,</hi> who though he ſtoutly fought the Lords battailes againſt the wicked worldlings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued not ſo much as a foile; yet when he had pampered his

                     <p>The laſt ſpirituall euill which the drunkard bringeth vpon himſelfe, is finall impenitencie;<note place="margin">§.

So the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaith of the drunkards of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, that they continued in <hi>drinking from morning to night, and they had the harpe and the viole, the timbrill and the pipe, and wine in their feaſts; but they regarded not the worke of the Lord, neither conſidered the workes of his hands,</hi> Eſa. 5.11.12.<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.11.12.</note> And partly becauſe they are deſperately reſolued to continue in their courſe, notwithſtanding they plainly diſcerne the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable euils which they bring vpon themſelues.

                        </note> in that he could ioyne theſe two together which are in nature ſo diſſonant: for being at a banquet taxed of follie, by a vaine babler, becauſe hee ſaid nothing whileſt others talked; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that euen this reaſon was ſufficient to acquit him of the imputation of follie; for what foole, I pray you (ſaid hee) can be ſilent in the middeſt of his cups?

                     <p>But as drunkenneſſe is the cauſe of much idle and vaine talking,<note place="margin">§.

If he be wantonly diſpoſed, then he vttereth nothing but ribauldrie and obſcene filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which will make chaſt eares to glow as much with heate, as his face with wine: for when by much drinking the heart is inflamed with luſt, it can no more be hid then fire in the boſome, but ſmoketh out in ribauld ſpeeches and filthie communication. But if choller haue the predominance in this drunken ſubiect, then doth it ſhew it ſelfe in raging, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and reuiling ſpeeches, ſo as there is no mans credit which they are not readie to impeach; no ſex, ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom they doe not loade with their opprobries; no ſanctuarie ſo ſafe which can priuiledge a mans name from the violent furie of their ſlanderous tongues.

                     <p>Neither is this vice of drunkenneſſe onely fruitfull in foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and wicked words,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>3.</hi> Drunkenneſſe diſcouereth other ſins.</note> but alſo in actions ſutable to their ſpeeches: for then they ſhew themſelues moſt odiouſlie wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, both becauſe they diſcouer that nakedneſſe of vice, which at other times they hide, and alſo runne into new out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages which are the vſuall companions of this ſin.

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10736:62"/>in that they wilfully incurre all theſe miſchiefes, for the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of a ſinne, that hath not in it ſo much as any reſpect of worldly good; for it is not accompanied with honour and credit, but with ſhame and reproch; it doth not bring with it profit and riches, but loſſe and pouertie; neither can there be any pleaſure in the vice it ſelfe: for what more delight can a man take to drinke when hee doth not thirſt, then to eate when he is not hungrie? to continue ſtill carouſing when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie he hath drunke too much, then preſently after a great feaſt to fall to eating againe vpon a ſurfetted and full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke? but onely that by long cuſtome they haue brought themſelues to an habite, and turned ſuperfluitie into neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: ſo that as thoſe who loade themſelues with clothes, are apt to take cold if they leaue off any one garment, though the one halfe were ſufficient to preſerue their bodies in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heate and ſtrength, if they were ſo accuſtomed; ſo theſe drunkards by long vſe haue brought vpon themſelues ſuch a neceſſitie of drinking, that their dropſie deſire is neuer ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor their inſatiable thirſt quenched, vnleſſe they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bibbing.</p>

                     <p>Now theſe cauſes are principally three:<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3. 1.</hi> Sottiſhnes the cauſe of drunkennes.</note> firſt, becauſe thoſe who are addicted to this vice are ſo infatuated and beſotted, that they neuer enter into any conſideration of their eſtate; but as they are ſenſeleſſe in feeling preſent miſeries, ſo they are ſecurely careleſſe in foreſeeing or auoiding future euils;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10736:62"/>like filthie ſwine feeding greedily on ſuch things as pleaſe the appetite, neuer conſidering that they doe but fat them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues for the ſhambles and ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, becauſe ſuch is their infidelity,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> The ſecond cauſe is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitie.</note> that though they heare theſe things, yet they beleeue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not, and being co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, they are not perſwaded: otherwiſe it is impoſſible that reaſonable creatures ſhould bee ſubiect to ſuch brutiſh folly, as to nouriſh a needleſſe and fruitleſſe vice, which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſo innumerable miſchiefs. If but a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon friend doe warne vs not to drinke in ſuch a cup, becauſe it is mixt with deadly poiſon; though the cup were of gold, and the drinke moſt delicious, yet who would taſte it? If a faithfull Phyſition ſhould forbid vs to feede on ſuch or ſuch a diſh, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring vs vpon his approued knowledge and certaine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that if wee eate of it wee ſhall either loſe our wits, or fall into grieuous diſeaſes, or indanger life it ſelfe; what man is ſo ſenſuall in his appetite, that would bee perſwaded for companie ſake, or to pleaſe his pallet, to feede vpon it? But the Lord who is a friend of friends, and a Phyſition of skill and faithfulnes without compare, hath forewarned vs to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide exceſſiue drinking, becauſe it will bring vpon vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable euils, both in our bodies and ſoules, temporall and ſpirituall, in this life and the life to come; and hath plainly told vs, that howſoeuer theſe are ſweete potions in the going downe, yet we ſhall finde them to be deadly poiſons in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and notwithſtanding all this, few are reclaimed from this vice, and that becauſe howſoeuer they giue him the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, yet in truth they beleeue him not.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> The third cauſe is their vaine excuſes.</note> they continue in this vice becauſe they haue ſome figge-leaues of vaine excuſes, whereby they indeuour to hide the vglie filthineſſe of their ſinne; partly defending it as being tollerable, and partly extenuating and excuſing it, as being light and veniall.<note place="margin">The <hi>1.</hi> excuſe, becauſe they are not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vvith drinke though they drinke much.</note> Firſt they thinke themſelues ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared from the ſinne of drunkenneſſe, and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the puniſhment, becauſe howſoeuer they drinke abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, yet ſuch is the ſtrength of their braine, that they are able to beare it without anie great diſtemperature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtill the vſe of their reaſon, memorie, and all their other
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10736:63"/>faculties as at other times. But ſuch are to know, that not onely drinking vnto drunkenneſſe, is condemned by Gods word; but alſo exceſſiue and immoderate drinking, when as men ſit much at the wine, and take their chiefe delight in tipling, yea it is a ſinne more hainous before God, then mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate drunkenneſſe, when as men drinking ſparingly, are yet ouertaken at vnawares, through the weakeneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of their braine; for they ſinne ſometimes vnaduiſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and in ſome ſort againſt their will, but the other continue in their vice vpon a deliberate purpoſe, voluntarilie and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; they through weakeneſſe of nature, theſe for want of grace.

To which I anſwere, that howſoeuer this prooueth the lawfull vſe of wine ioyned with ſobrietie and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet it ſerueth nothing to approoue the abuſe in exceſſe and drunkenneſſe, nay rather the contrarie from hence may be concluded; for it was giuen to make the penſiue merrie, and the ſorrowfull glad, and not to make thoſe who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie merrie, mad and franticke. It was giuen to cheere the heart, and not to oppreſſe it; to comfort the ſtomacke, and not to loade and glut it; to worke in vs ſuch a ſpirituall ioy, as ſhould intice vs to praiſe Gods name in the fruition of his gifts, of which our Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſpeaketh, Cap. 2.15. and not ſuch a worldly and carnall ioy, as ſheweth it ſelfe in filthie ribauldrie, and impious blaſphemies.

                     <p>Laſtly, they alleage for the defence of their drunkenneſſe,<note place="margin">§.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10736:64"/>they are ſubiect. To which I anſwere, that if it be accounted a ſottiſh follie to ſtaunch the bleeding of the finger, by woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the heart, then much more to cure the bodie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the ſoule; for if drunkenneſſe be a ſinne (as all men confeſſe) and if the <hi>wages of ſinne be death eternall,</hi> of ſoule and bodie,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.23.</note> as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, Rom. 6.23. If finally it make all men who commit it,<note place="margin">Deut. 27.26.</note> liable to Gods feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full curſe denounced in his law, Deut. 27.26. then what mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it, wilfully and preſumptuouſly to ruſh into ſinne, which is accompanied with eternal deſtruction of bodie and ſoule, for the recouerie of our bodilie health; to hazard the fee-ſimple of our euerlaſting patrimonie, for the reparing of our earthlie tabernacles, yea the priſon of our ſoules, and to venter the loſſe of eternall happineſſe in Gods kingdome, for the prolonging of our miſerable pilgrimage in this wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched world. Beſides, the Lord hath ordained manie ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne meanes and remedies of lawful Phyſicke, vpon the vſe whereof we may much more aſſuredly expect Gods bleſſing, for our recouerie, then vpon this euill and ſinfull meanes, which he hath branded with his curſe. And therefore when the Phyſitians receipt is contrarie to the preſcript of Gods word, let vs reiect it as ſent from hell; and as one ſaith, <hi>Cum turpis est medicma ſanari pudeat:</hi> Let vs rather die of an honeſt diſeaſe, then preſerue life by a diſhoneſt medicine.</p>
                     <p>Others there are,<note place="margin">§.

And firſt they ſay, that for themſelues they haue no liking of this vice, but onely are drawne into it ſomtimes by reaſon of their companie. To which I anſwere, that that is a bad fellowſhip which brings vs into a league with vice, and makes vs to ſet vertue at vtter defiance; that is a wicked knot of friendſhip which ties vs both to the euil of ſinne, and the euill of puniſhment, and it will prooue but a ſottiſh dotage in the end, if rather then wee will part with wicked companions, we will in fooliſh kindnes accompanie them into hell. If therefore our companions delight in ſin, let not vs delight in them, but flee their ſocietie as being the diuels aduocates to ſolicite vs vnto wickedneſſe; and let vs
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10736:64"/>take heede leſt whileſt wee labour to maintaine friendſhip with men, we doe not proclaime enmitie againſt God. They are but bad ſeruants who will keepe companie with their maſters enemies, and ioyne with them in their leaud courſes, eſpecially after he hath ſeriouſlie warned them to forſake it; but wee profeſſe our ſelues the ſeruants of God, and hee hath ſtraitly charged vs to leaue the fellowſhip of wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and eſpecially of ſuch as liue in drunkenneſſe, becauſe their fellowſhip will corrupt vs and allure vs by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and inticements, to the committing of the ſame ſinnes. Thus the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> chargeth vs from God, that we <hi>ſhould not keepe companie with drunkards and gluttons,</hi> Prou. 23.20.<note place="margin">Pro. 23.20.</note> So the Apoſtle inioyneth vs that we ſhould not haue any fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, nor ſo much as eate with a drunkard, 1.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, they alleage for their excuſe,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>10.</hi> The fifth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, that it is the cuſtome of the countrie.</note> that this exceſſiue drinking is the vſuall cuſtome of the countrie, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe of the people where they dwell; and therefore they are the rather to be excuſed, if they behaue themſelues like other men, ſeeing ſingularitie would make them odious, and bring them to contempt. To which I anſwere, that cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, not grounded vpon either reaſon or religion, is the worſt kinde of barbarous tyrannie, that a common faſhion diſſonant from Gods word is no better then a common ſin, which bringeth vpon whole nations vniuerſall iudgements; and therefore we muſt not ioyne with them in their ſinnes, if we would be diſioyned from them in their puniſhments. That as communitie commendeth that which is good, ſo it aggrauateth that which is euill; that Chriſtians muſt not liue by prophane examples, but by Gods holy precepts; that we are expreſly charged by God not to <hi>follow a multitude to doe euill,</hi> Exod. 23.2.<note place="margin">Exod. 23.2.</note> That we muſt not <hi>faſhion our ſelues like vnto the world, but labour to finde out Gods will, that wee may conforme our liues thereunto,</hi> Rom. 12.2.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> That if we will needs liue by example, we muſt propound for our imitation thoſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10736:65"/>who are moſt godlie and religious, and not thoſe who are moſt in number. For it is better being with <hi>Noah</hi> alone in the Arke, then to bee in the flouriſhing aſſemblies of wicked worldlings; to ioyne with righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> then with all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; to bee in the ſmall number of Chriſts little flocke which are to be ſaued, then in the numerous heards of goats, which are deſtinated to deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>11.6.</hi> Excuſe taken from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of holie men.</note> they extenuate their vice of drunkenneſſe, as not deſeruing the cenſure of an hainous ſinne, ſeeing the holy Patriarches <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> fell into it. But by the ſame reaſon they might as well conclude, that murther and adulterie are but ſmall and veniall ſinnes, becauſe holie <hi>Dauid</hi> committed them, and that it is but a light offence to denie and forſweare Chriſt our Sauiour, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle was ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with it. Yea in truth they may thus excuſe idolatrie, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie, pride, couetouſnes, &amp; al other hainous wickednes, ſeeing the deareſt children of God are not priuiledged from them, nor any other pardonable ſin: but onely from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing and liuing in them. Againe, theſe faithfull ſeruants of God, did not often fall into this ſin of drunkennes, for <hi>Noah</hi> fell into it but once, and that as it ſeemeth vpon ignorance, becauſe hee did not know the propertie and operation of wine, the vſe whereof himſelfe inuented; whereby hee was alſo the more eaſilie ouertaken, as being ouerioyed when he taſted ſuch excellent fruites of his owne labours. And <hi>Lot</hi> was but twice ouertaken, and that by the allurement of his owne daughters, to which he was more apt to giue eare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their hearts being oppreſſed with griefe for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sodome, the loſſe of his goods, and ſuddaine death of his wife, he tooke more libertie in the vſe of theſe creatures for their comfort and refreſhing. So that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer theſe holy men were ouertaken once or twice with drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, yet they were no drunkards; for we muſt put a difference betweene thoſe who fall into this ſinne through infirmitie, and thoſe who make it their vſuall practiſe; and conſequently, theſe examples ſerue no better for their excuſe who liue and continue in this vice, then <hi>Peters</hi> once deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his maſter excuſeth them, who make a totall and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

Now for concluſion of this treatiſe we are briefly to ſhew, that as it is a great ſinne to liue in this vice ones ſelfe, ſo it is no leſſe grieuous in the ſight of God to be guiltie of anothers drunkenneſſe. In which reſpect many in our daies fearfully offend,<note place="margin">Some delight in others drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe.</note> and that in a diuers manner; for ſome take delight to ſee others drunken, and make a ſport and may-game of their neighbours ſinne; as though it were fit matter to moue laughter, to ſee God diſhonored, his name blaſphemed, his creatures abuſed; and to behold our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours nakedneſſe, and as it were from a man transformed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beaſt; yea in truth in a farre worſe condition, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his preſent ſtate, and future danger, in that he taketh a readie courſe to runne headlong into hell.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10736:66"/>of their poore brethren, cannot wring from them one penie, for the reliefe of their extreme want, or ſo much as a peece of bread to ſatisfie their hunger and ſuſtaine their liues; yet are they open handed and prodigally liberall, in ſpending their money to make their neighbours drunke, that ſo they may make themſelues merrie in beholding their nakedneſſe. But this will make a fearfull reckoning at the day of iudgement, when God and their owne conſciences ſhall accuſe them of their graceleſſe miſpending y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lords talents, by pinching the hungrie to pamper the full; by withholding drinke from the thirſtie, to make others drunke with too great abundance; by denying a penie to the poore needie, vnleſſe it bee ſquized out of them by authoritie; whereas they are willing prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally to ſpend ſhillings and pounds in theſe wicked abuſes, which tend to Gods diſhonour, and the deſtruction of their neighbour.</p>
                     <p>But howſoeuer this is a high degree of ſinne,<note place="margin">§.

Let vs alſo conſider, that our bodies are the temples of the holie Ghoſt, the which we ſhall exceedingly diſhonour, if by drinking and ſwilling we make them to become like vnto wine-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.

Let vs alſo remember, that as in it ſelfe it is moſt ſinfull, ſo alſo it is a cauſe of other ſinnes, and a fruitfull mother of all wickedneſſe: as of the manifold and horrible abuſes of the tongue, of manie wicked and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious actions, and particularly of thoſe fearefull ſinnes of murther and adulterie. Let vs alſo call to minde, that as it is the cauſe of ſinne, ſo alſo of many heauie and grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; for it maketh a man liable to a fearefull woe, and Gods heauie curſe; it ſubiecteth his name to infamie and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, his ſtate to beggerie, his bodie to diſeaſes and imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture death, his ſoule to ſenſeleſſe ſottiſhneſſe, and depriuing the whole man of the ioyes of heauen, entreth him into the poſſeſſion of eternall helliſh torments.

                     <p>In conſideration whereof,<note place="margin">§.

And howſoeuer the grand ſinckes and filthie ſewers of the land, the common ſteues, which heretofore were to the ſhame of religion either licenſed or tolerated, are now by the laudable care of our Magiſtrates taken away, ſo as our countrie is not ſo noyſome through the confluence of the common filth, nor the vncleanneſſe ſo great an eyeſore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it doth not as in former times lie open to publike view; yet the filthineſſe of our people is not cleane purged with the cleare ſtreames of true repentance; but rather the common ſincke is deuided into many filthie channels which runne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely into priuate houſes, and make euerie corner noyſom
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10736:71"/>and infectious, eſpecially in the outparts and ſuburbs of our greateſt cities. And though the common peſt bee eaſed and emptied of theſe perſons infected with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contagious plague of vncleaneſſe, yet the danger is neuer the leſſe, ſeeing they are not cured of their diſeaſes, but onely remooued and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the garden houſes; where they lie hid from thoſe onely which ſhould reforme or puniſh them, and not from thoſe who may be infected or corrupted by them: yea in truth the perill is hereby accidentally increaſed, becauſe the contagion is diſperſed into many places; into which many of our people vnwittingly reſorting are infected at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and fall into the ſecret ambuſhments of theſe filthie harlots when they leaſt ſuſpect any danger: and thoſe who are ill diſpoſed haue no leſſe free acceſſe to theſe places, then they formerly had to the common ſtewes, and with leſſe feare of ſhame, or note of infamie, becauſe their haunt is now more ſecret and vnſuſpected. So that theſe vnſauorie ſinckes are onely ſtirred in, but not cleanſed; and theſe corrupt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the bodie of our State, are onely a little mooued, but not remooued and purged away.</p>

And to theſe we may adde the too great mildnes of our lawes, which impoſe ouer light puniſhments vpon theſe hainous ſinnes; as the ſtanding in a white ſheete, or at moſt a few ſtripes with a whip, which notwithſtanding is oftentimes not inflicted, partly through
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10736:71"/>the careleſnes or conniuencie of Magiſtrates, and partly through the negligence or corruption of vnder officers; or elſe at leaſt is turned from a perſonall puniſhment, which ſhould be for the example of others, into a penall or purſe mulct, which for the moſt part is conuerted to their owne vſe who doe impoſe it.</p>

For whereas all kinde of euill may be reduced to two heads, as being either the euill of ſinne, or the euill of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; this ſinne of fornication compriſeth them both, like an euill, yet fruitfull tree, bearing both the ſommer fruite of ſinne, and the autumne and after fruite of puniſhment. Firſt, that it is out of meaſure ſinfull, it may hereby appeare, in that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10736:75"/>it is not only in it ſelfe a grieuous ſin, but alſo like a wicked mother onely fruitfull in wicked and monſtrous births, it bringeth forth many other kindes of wickedneſſe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the parent in their malignant nature and qualitie, ſo as they may be eaſily knowne to be of her ofſpring and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie.

The which ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes for the deflouring of their ſiſter, becauſe the ſhame thereof redounded not only to her ſelfe, but to her father and friends; for ſo it is ſaid, that they were grieued and <hi>very angrie, becauſe this villanie was committed in Iſrael,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 34.7.</note> and becauſe <hi>Sichem</hi> had lien with <hi>Iacobs daughter.</hi> And this was the cauſe why the high Prieſts daughter playing the harlot, was by the law of God to be burnt with fire, becauſe by her whoredome ſhe had polluted her father: as it is Leuit. 21.9.<note place="margin">Leuit. 21.9.</note> And ſecondly, in that hereby robbing their children or friends of grace, vertue, and that chiefe ornament of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they alſo depriue their hearts of all true ioy and ſound comfort, which they otherwiſe might haue had of them, when as being priuie to their ſinne they cannot looke vpon them without ſhame and bluſhing; nor acknowledge them for their owne vnto others, leſt they may ſeeme to haue ſome intereſt in their faults.</p>
                     <p>So alſo they ſinne grieuouſly againſt their owne children begotten in fornication, and that before they are borne,<note place="margin">§ Sect. <hi>5.</hi> The fornicator ſinneth againſt his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren begotten in fornication.</note> and afterwards: for they ingraine them in the deepe die of their ſinne, which wil neuer be waſhed out, although it may be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with their vertues, and brand them with the infamous marke of baſtardie, before they breathe the aire. They make the poore infant beare the puniſhment of their ſinne, euen whileſt it ſelfe is borne in the mothers bellie, and before it hath any name giuen it, they intitle it to the infamous ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10736:79"/>of a baſe baſtard. They alſo rob it of their owne loue, not for any faultines in the childe, but for the guilt of their owne ſinne; in which reſpect whileſt it is in the wombe, the mother wiſheth that it may bee a falſe conception and abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue; and the father, that it may neuer liue to ſee the Sunne. When it is borne, they are readie to thinke, that when it cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it proclaimeth their ſinne, and when it beginneth to ſpeake they bluſh for ſhame, when they heare themſelues called vpon by the ſweete names of father and mother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thereby their ſinne is called to remembrance. And as they do communicate to their poore children the ſhame and puniſhment of their faults, ſo alſo their ſinnes and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions themſelues; for they poiſon them in the bud, and the fountaine of generation being defiled with filthie. luſt and vncleannes, polluteth alſo the ſtreames which iſſue from it: ſo that it is no rare thing to ſee ſuch children reſemble their parents in their vnchaſt manners, more then in their face and countenance. All which iniuries they recompenſe, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelues more iniurious; for as they hated them in the birth, ſo they neglect them commonly in their growth; and make amends for their ſinfull generation, with giuing vnto them looſe and prophane education; whereby they grow in their corruptions, faſter then in the ſtature of their bodie. And yet this is not halfe the miſchiefe which they do vnto them; for beſides all this, as much as in them lieth they exclude them out of the couenant of grace, and blot them out of the number of Gods people and family, the which the Lord will haue procreated and increaſed with a holie ſeede,<note place="margin">Matth. 2.15.</note> whereas they remaine polluted being the children of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and vncleane ſeede of vncleane parents.<note place="margin">1.

A notable place wee haue to this purpoſe in the booke of Wiſedome,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 3 16.17.</note> where many of theſe euils are expreſſed: Chap. 3.16. <hi>The children of whoremongers ſhall not be partakers of holy

For families being defiled, the commonwealth cannot be cleane, ſeeing they are the roote from which it ſpringeth; the priuate Seminaries wherby the large orchard of the State is ſtored and furniſhed, and as it were the particular members of this great bodie. If therefore the bud and bloſſome bee blaſted and corrupted in the familie, they will hardly euer bring forth good fruite in the common-wealth; if the roote be poiſoned, the tree cannot flouriſh, and if the particular members be rotten and full of corruption, the bodie cannot be whole and ſound. Beſides, as they defile the common-wealth with ſin, ſo they make it grone vnder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heauy waight of Gods iudgements: for as the Prophet ſpeaketh, becauſe of the fornications of the people the land mourneth,<note place="margin">Ier. 23.10.</note> neither taſting of any of Gods gratious benefits, whereby it might be nouriſhed, nor clothing it ſelfe with her beautifull fruits, as it were with her kingly coate of diuers colours, but ſitteth in the darke, deſolate and forſaken, being depriued of the comfortable beames of Gods fauour, which ſhould ripen all her hopes.

Now I am further to prooue, that as this ſin of whoredome is in it ſelfe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſinfull, ſo alſo it is the cauſe of diuers other grieuous ſinnes: for when the conſcience is defiled with this pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſinne, it is made fit to admit and intertaine the fouleſt vices, and moſt enormous crimes, and ſuch a large breach being made therein, it is eaſily ouerflowed and drowned with a flood of wickedneſſe. More eſpecially, fornication is the cauſe of greater ſinnes of the ſame kinde, as for example
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10736:84"/>of adulterie; for it is vſually ſeene by common experience, that a young fornicatour maketh an old adulterer, and hee who in the prime of his age maketh no conſcience of defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his neighbours childe, ripening in wickedneſſe as hee ripeneth in yeeres, when he commeth to maturitie will make no conſcience of defiling his neighbours wife. So alſo it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the way &amp; maketh an eaſie entrance for inceſt, Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, buggerie, &amp; all manner of abominable filthines, which euen corrupted nature is aſhamed to owne,<note place="margin">Eph. 5 3.</note> and are not ſo much as to be named among Chriſtians, but with hatred and deteſtation. And this commeth to paſſe partly through the iuſt iudgement of God, who for their former filthineſſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them vp to a reprobate ſenſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> and to the ſlauerie of their owne filthie affections and vnnaturall luſts, to runne on in their ſinne with greedineſſe to their vtter perdition; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the nature of ſinne which is in continuall growth, and if it bee not nipped in the bud or ſprig, becommeth in ſhort time a tree of huge largenes; if it bee not cruſhed and killed in the ſhell, it will like the Cockatrice grow to ſuch a poiſonous nature, that it will kill with the very looke. The which as it is verified of all other, ſo eſpecially of theſe ſinnes of vncleannes. For after they are conceiued by naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, and borne with delight, and nurſed with wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes, at laſt being fed with curioſitie as it were with their complete nouriſhment, they grow vnto vnnaturall ſhapes, and in the end become hidious monſters moſt vgly and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in the ſight of God and men. And laſtly, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe through the cunning malice of our old enemie the diuell, who when hee cannot at the firſt thruſt into the doore of our harts &amp; conſciences the greateſt ſins, doth make way &amp; entrance for them by thoſe which are leſſe. Like vnto thoſe, who not being able by any poſſible meanes to thruſt the fruite into a glaſſe with a narrow mouth in his full ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, doe put it in when it is young and new knit, and ſo let it grow, being ſtill nouriſhed with the roote, vnto his naturall bignes, till it haue filled the glaſſe; whereby they make that eaſie by art which is impoſſible in nature. Or like vnto miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieuous theeues, who intending to rob a houſe, and being

So this malicious gardener Satan, being not able to thruſt into our hearts and conſciences the euill fruit of ſinne in his full ripeneſſe, doth put it into them as it were in the bud, knowing that being nouriſhed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſap, which is deriued from the roote of our naturall corruption, it will quickly grow to his full bigneſſe. And this arch-theefe the diuell intending to rob vs of the riches of Gods graces, and not being able to enter with his moſt enormous crimes, as it were his aſſociates of the greateſt ſize; doth firſt thruſt into our ſoules and conſciences his ſmaller ſins, the which being entred, open a large doore, and giue entrance vnto all manner outragious wickedneſſe.</p>

Of the other we haue an example in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maziah</hi> the Prieſt, who becauſe he deſpiſed Gods word, and oppoſed againſt the Prophet <hi>Amos,</hi> had this heauie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced againſt him: Amos 7.16. <hi>Thou ſaist,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>And thus it appeareth that whoredome is the puniſhment of other ſinnes, and that no ſmall puniſhment,<note place="margin">§.

In this life the Lord inflicteth on it both priuate and publicke puniſhments. The puniſhments which are impoſed vpon priuate men are either temporall or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: The fornicatour is puniſhed with temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments both in his ſtate, perſon and poſteritie; in his ſtate hee is puniſhed with pouertie and extreme beggerie; for this burning luſt is as a conſuming fire, which deuoureth all the ſubſtance, and bringeth men of great wealth to ſuch extreme penurie,<note place="margin">Prou 6.26.</note> that they are (as the Wife man ſaith) glad to beg a peece of bread.

<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10736:87"/>yet is compaſſed and bought at the higheſt prices. For much is ſpent vpon filthie bawdes and pandors, which are their inſtruments and factors which they vſe for the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their deſires; much is conſumed vpon their harlots in gifts and rewards, as money, apparell, iewels, ornaments, in muſicke, dancing, reuelling, feaſting and banquetting, all which is beſtowed to pleaſe their ſtrumpets, and to inflame their owne luſts, which naturally would ſoone languiſh and faint, if they were not reuiued, and anew reinforced by theſe incitements and prouocations, which are the fuell of luſt whereby it is kindled and nouriſhed.

For whereas the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed reaſon as the chiefe viceroy in the little world of man, whereby all his parts and members are to be ruled and gouerned, as it were obedient ſubiects; the fornicatour ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with his baſeſt parts, euen his vncleane luſts, rebelleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his lawfull Soueraigne, and thruſting reaſon out of his throne, ſubiecteth himſelfe to be gouerned by his vnruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and filthie affections.

Whereof it commeth to paſſe that there is nothing ſo abominable which is not thought tolerable, nothing ſo ſhamefull which will cauſe bluſhing, nothing ſo diſhoneſt and outragious which they are not readie to act for the pleaſing and ſatisfying of their luſts. For howſoeuer things were vnto them free and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrarie, before they had yeelded themſelues as ſlaues to their vile affections, yet when they are once inthronized in their hearts, they tyrannically impoſe vpon them an vnreſiſtable neceſſitie of obedience.

If ſhe calleth hee muſt come; if ſhe ſendeth, her very commaund addeth wings to his haſte; if ſhe biddeth depart, hee dare not abide in her companie, though a ſhort abſence ſeemeth vnto him a tedious baniſhment; if ſhe biddeth ſtay, he remaineth vnder her arreſt, and hath no libertie to depart. If ſhe want, his purſe muſt bee at her commandement; if ſhe maligne, his perſon muſt bee expoſed to all dangers in reuenge of her quarrell. That I may ſay nothing of his continuall hopes, feares, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, griefe, ielouſies, quarrels, truces, wherewith he is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe tormented, then if hee were daily vpon a torturing rack, ſauing that himſelfe chuſeth his tormentor, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily indureth this helliſh puniſhment.

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10736:95"/>They abuſe themſelues by imagining that they can by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſatisfie for their ſinne, and ſo ſecurely paſſe it ouer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance; whereas in truth there is no other meanes to waſh their defiled bodies and ſoules from the pollution of their ſinne, but the precious blood of the immaculate Lambe Ieſus Chriſt. They depriue themſelues of all aſſurance and comfort of Gods bleſſing vpon their mariage into which they make ſuch a wicked entrance; for how can they hope for a good proceeding, where the beginning is ſo wicked and vnlawfull? how can they expect that God will build that houſe whoſe very foundation is laid in ſinne? that hee will make them a happie couple who were firſt ioyned in forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation? or cauſe her to become a vertuous wife vnto him, who hath alreadie abuſed her as his ſtrumpet? Againe, what greater iniurie can hee offer vnto her whom hee pretendeth chiefly to loue, ſeeing hee expoſeth her to the danger of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall infamie and reproch? For who hath aſſured him that he ſhall liue to ſolemnize the promiſed mariage, eſpecially ſeeing the Lord might in his iuſtice preſently inflict death of bodie and ſoule for his ſinne? and if hee doe not, what doth he but die a fornicatour, and leaue her to liue a reputed har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, by her owne deſert and others eſtimation? But though it ſhould be granted that he had procured from heauen a leaſe of his life, yet what wrong in the meane time doth hee offer her to whom he pretendeth mariage, ſeeing he maketh her his harlot before he maketh her his wife? and ſpoiling her of her honeſtie and virginitie, maketh her fit to enter into the ſtewes, before he admitteth her into the honourable bed of mariage? What iniurie is this to blemiſh her good name which he ſhould moſt honour? For howſoeuer hee hath by mariage cured the wound which hee hath made in her repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo as it is not mortall to her credit, yet there euer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth as it were a running iſſue of rumour, and infamie, or at leaſt a foule ſcarre (if euer it come to light) in others eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or (if it remaine ſecret) in their owne conſciences, which will euer after make them more iealous the one of the other. Finally, he ſinneth againſt the fruite of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10736:95"/>in that he begetteth it of the ſeede of fornication, imba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it in his conception, and marking it with the ſtampe of his ſinne, before it enioyeth the light of the Sunne.</p>

In the next place I am to ſpeake of the ſinne of adulterie, which is that vncleanneſſe that is committed by thoſe that are either married or betrothed; for the law of God as deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie condemneth, and as ſeuerely puniſheth the latter as the former, as appeareth, Deut. 22.22.24.<note place="margin">Deut. 22.22.24.</note> In which argument I will obſerue the ſame order which I did in the former, ſhewing firſt what it is, and the kinds thereof, the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſinne, and the grieuouſneſſe of the puniſhment.

                     <p>Firſt then,<note place="margin">§.

For whereas the Lord hath ordained, that by marriage there ſhould be ſuch a neere communion between the parties conioyned, that they ſhuld be no more two but one fleſh, in regard wherof a man ought to forſake father and mother, that he may cleaue to his wife, louing and cheriſhing her as being a part of himſelfe; and that to theſe ends, that they may bee preſerued from whoredome and all manner of vnlawfull luſts, procreate an holy ſeede, and be mutuall comforts one to another; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator doth vtterly violate this holy ordinance; for he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyneth thoſe whom God hath conioyned, and breaketh the bond of holy marriage by ioyning himſelfe with an harlot, and becomming one fleſh with her, hee forſaketh his deere ſpouſe, for whoſe ſake he ſhould forſake father and mother, and adhereth to a filthie ſtrumpet; he loatheth his wife, and loueth his whore; he defileth his bodie and ſoule, created ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods image in holineſſe and purity, with whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and vncleanneſſe; he begetteth an vnholy ſeede and baſterdly brood, and becommeth vnto his wife, of a chiefe comforter, a moſt grieuous tormentor, filling her heart with

<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10736:97"/>flames of luſt, at firſt he is thereby vrged to thruſt in as an vniuſt ſharer in another mans right; but being intruded hee doth not ſo content himſelfe, but ſcorning to haue any copartner or corriuall in his loue, hee laboureth to haue the intire intereſt and to become the ſole owner of his delights. And becauſe the husband of his harlot ſtandeth in his way and croſſeth his deſires, hee ſeeketh by all meanes to bring him to deſtruction, both by open violence, if the law doe not reſtraine him, and by ſecret trecherie.

Whereas they mutually promiſed mariage loue, which farre ſurpaſſeth the loue of parents to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their children, both in excellencie and in proprietie, they fixe their loue vpon ſtrangers, and loath their yoke-fellowes, as if they were their mortall enemies. Neither is it poſſible that the adulterous wife ſhould loue her husband, when ſhe is beſotted with the loue of her filthie copes-mate, nor for an adulterer to loue his wife, when he is intangled in the harlots ſnares, and carried away with her bewitching al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements. And this is that breach of couenant which the Lord laieth to the Iſraelites charge as a grieuous ſinne: Mal. 2.14. <hi>The Lord hath been witneſſe betweene thee,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, whereas by mariage there is alſo a communion of their goods and perſons, by vertue whereof they haue iuſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10736:98"/>intereſt and proprietie both in their ſtates and bodies, the adulterers do robbe their yoke-fellow of their right; for firſt the adulterous husband ſpendeth his ſubſtance in maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his harlot, and in nouriſhing and bringing vp his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous broode; whereby hee impoueriſheth his wife, and bringeth her vnto want and miſerie, either becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiencie of his eſtate to maintaine both his harlot, and his owne charge; or through the hardnes of his heart, and want of loue to his own ſpouſe; for it is the vſuall fruite of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and adulterie, to make a man prodigall abroad, and niggardly at home, bountifull to his harlot, and all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto her; and miſerably neere, and ſordidous, to his wife, and his lawfull begotten children. So alſo the adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wife robbeth her husband, not onely by catching and purloining all ſhe may from him, to beſtow vpon her louers; but alſo in bringing into his familie an adulterous iſſue, who deuoure the fruite of his labours, and confuſedly diuide his ſubſtance and patrimonie amongſt his owne children. In which reſpect the adulterie of the wife is more pernicious then of the husband, becauſe it is accompanied with more abominable deceit, no man being able, who hath an harlot to his wife, to know his owne children, from the children of a ſtranger, whereby hee is compelled to nouriſh his enemies, for feare of deſtroying his chiefeſt friends; and to giue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance to the children of fornication, leſt otherwiſe through his ignorance he may perchance diſinherit the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruite of his owne bodie.</p>

For why ſhould hee ſteale of his neighbour that hath plentie of water in his owne ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterne? as the Wiſe man ſpeaketh.<note place="margin">Prou. 5.15.19.</note> Why ſhould hee delight himſelfe in vnlawfull luſts with a ſtranger, vnto whom God hath giuen a wife in whom hee may reioyce, as being neere vnto him, euen as a part of himſelfe; and who may bee vnto him (if the fault be not his owne either in his choice, or vſe) <hi>as the louing Hinde and pleaſant Roe;</hi>

                     <p>And therefore our Chriſtian Magiſtrates are to be exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that they would not lightly account of this ſinne of whoredome, which the law of God and the law of nations, hath condemned as capitall; but that they would enact ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere lawes for the puniſhment of this ſinne, which is ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable

For when Magiſtrates neglect their dutie in puniſhing this ſinne, then the Lord will take the ſword of iuſtice into his owne hand, according to that, Heb. 13.4.<note place="margin">Heb. 13.4.

                        <hi>Whoremongers and adulterers God will iudge.</hi> So he ſaith, Mal. 3.5. that himſelfe would come neere vnto the people of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi> in iudgement, and would be a ſwife witneſſe againſt the adulterers: and Ier. 5.7.8.9.<note place="margin">Ier. 5.7.8.</note> he profeſſeth that in his inſtice he could not ſpare them who were guiltie of this ſinne of whoredome, but would viſit them, and be auenged on them for this and ſuch other abominations.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the puniſhments which the Lord vſually inflicteth vpon adulterers in this life,<note place="margin">§.

As firſt hee puniſheth adulterie by the law of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall, and as they defile other mens wiues, ſo hee ſuffereth other men to abuſe theirs with the like filthines and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                        <note place="margin">2. Sam. 12.11. and 16.22.</note> and afterwards inflicted vpon him for his adulterie with <hi>Vriahs</hi> wife, 2. Sam. 12.11. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,

For if fornicators ſhall be depriued of the ioyes of heauen, and haue their portion in hell fire, euen in the lake which bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fire and brimſtone, as before I haue ſhewed; then ſurely the adulterers, whoſe ſinne is much more vnexcuſable and hainous, ſhall be plunged into a farre deeper degree of condemnation, and be much more exquiſitely tormented in thoſe helliſh torments.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus haue I ſpoken of the ſinnes of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> The firſt means is to reclaime our willes from vncleanneſſe by conſidering euils which the doe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie it.</note> both of fornication, which is that filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that is committed betweene ſingle per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and of adulterie, which is committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene married folkes; and haue prooued that they are not only hainous ſins, but alſo that they are attented vpon with innumerable miſchiefes, and puniſhed with feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full puniſhments both in this life, and the life to come. Now in the laſt place I will ſet downe ſome meanes, whereby wee may be the better inabled to preſerue our bodies in puritie and chaſtitie, and bee either reſtrained or reclaimed from whoredome and vncleanneſſe. The which meanes are either common preſeruatiues from all manner of filthie luſts, or more proper remedies againſt adulterie. Concerning the former, if we would be preſerued from whoredome and all manner of filthineſſe, it behooueth vs firſt to reclaime our willes, and to worke in our hearts and affections an vtter ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and deteſtation of this ſin, ſo as we may deſire nothing more then to be preſerued from it, if we be yet innocent; or at leaſt, may be reclaimed, if we haue offended. For as it is in vaine to preſcribe good medicines to ſuch a patient, as being in loue with his diſeaſes, will not receiue them; ſo it is in vaine to thinke of meanes to preſerue vs from ſinne, if wee ſtill haue a liking of it, or of remedies to cure our ſpiritual diſeaſes, if we be not come to an earneſt deſire and hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to part with them. To this purpoſe therefore let vs in the firſt place often meditate with our ſelues, of that which hath been alreadie ſpoken, both concerning the hainouſnes of the ſinne, and the greatneſſe of the puniſhment. As for
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10736:102"/>example, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is in a high degree, a notorious breach of Gods commandement, the tranſgreſſion whereof is accompanied with a fearefull curſe, that is is a badge of ſuch an one as God hateth, and a notable fruite of the fleſh in which whoſoeuer liue, ſhall die eternally. That he who committeth it, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſlie ſinneth againſt God, his neighbour, and himſelfe, and that in manie reſpects as hath been ſhewed: That it is a cauſe alſo of many other ſinnes, the leaſt wherof deſerueth eternall death. That howſoeuer carnall men make it their idoll and chiefe delight, yet in truth it is a fearefull puniſhment of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other grieuous ſinnes. That it ſelfe alſo hath many feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full puniſhments attending vpon it, for it ruineth a mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, it expoſeth his name to infamie and reproch, it maketh him a ſlaue to his owne filthie luſts, and a vaſſall to an odious ſtrumpet: it infatuateth the mind, and bridgeth vpon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die lothſome diſeaſes, and vntimely death: it ſubiecteth a man to Gods fearce wrath, and cauſeth impenitencie and hardneſſe of heart: it ſetteth the offender vpon a continuall racke, and haunteth him like a helliſh furie: and in a word, it diſpoſſeſſeth him of the ioyes of heauen, and caſteth him headlong into the lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. And if hauing put into the one skole theſe manifold euils of ſinne and puniſhment, we alſo put into the other the pleaſure and profit of this ſinne, and conſider with our ſelues how that we vndergoe all theſe miſchiefes for the ſatisfying of our brutiſh luſts, and for the inioying of a vaine, ſhort and beaſtly pleaſure; it is not poſſible (if wee be not altogether blockiſh and void of common ſenſe) but that we ſhould hate and abhorre this ſinne, and earneſtly labour in the vſe of all good meanes, whereby we may bee preſerued and deliuered from it.</p>
                     <p>Now theſe meanes which may bee vſed for this purpoſe are manifold;<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond meanes is to purifie our hearts from filthineſſe.</note> firſt, wee muſt labour to purge and purifie our hearts from vncleane luſts, as being the verie fountaines of all filthineſſe and pollution; and to withſtand to the vttermoſt of our power the firſt motions and inclinations which draw vs vnto this ſinne. For as Chriſtians ought to bee ſo farre off from committing theſe works of darkenes, that they ſhould
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10736:102"/>not ſo much as take their names into their mouthes, as the Apoſtle telleth vs; ſo alſo they ſhould not giue them the leaſt intertainement into their hearts; but as ſoone as the tentation or motion vnto vncleannes is caſt into their mind, they are at the firſt to reiect it as abominable, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolue it in their thoughts, nor to fight with theſe vncleane luſts, as it were at handi-blowes, but rather by skilfull ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and auoiding of them. For if we ſuffer them to reſt any while in our hearts, they will be able to make a ſtrong partie of our owne corruptions, and the longer they are retained, the more hardly they will be repelled. To this purpoſe <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Quum alijs vitijs poteſt exſpectari conflictus,</hi>

In this conflict therefore the Chriſtian muſt imitate the Parthians fight, who neuer fought better then when they did make the ſpeedieſt flight, neither muſt he indure the approch of theſe enemies, and much leſſe intertaine any diſputation with them, for they who enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a parlie, are not farre from yeelding, if they like the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the truce.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath this contagion tainted one place alone, but hath infected and poyſoned the moſt part, if not the whole ſtate of Chriſtendome: and as it was truely ſaid in the waining

For is not that found true in the common experience of theſe times, which the Wiſe man obſerued in his daies,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 10.19.</note> that <hi>monie anſwereth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all,</hi> ruleth all, diſpoſeth all? and doe not almoſt all men make a cleere paſſage vnto themſelues by gifts and rewards, for the atchieuing of their deſires, and with theſe golden raies ripen all their hopes? Doe but looke into the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and we ſhall find this no falſe imputation laide vpon the Chriſtian State, but a lamentable truth to be bewailed with deepe grones, and mournefull teares. For howſoeuer king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes themſelues and free monarchies bee vnualuable, and aboue the pitch of any price, yet what is there in kingdomes which are not dailie compaſſed by rewards? By this ladder ſome mount vp into the ſeate of eminencie, purchaſing by gifts titles, which neuer came to them by, inheritance, or by deſert; neither doe they now as in former times, ennoble and dignifie themſelues, by venturing their life, &amp; ſpending their blood in the defence of their countrie; but haue found a ſpeedier and more eaſie courſe for the ſatiſfying their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious deſires, namely, by friends bought with gifts.

So heretofore men were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred vnto offices for their ſeruice, ſufficiencie and deſert; but now the vſual entrance into them is by large gifts; which way is ſo common, by reaſon all the other paſſages are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp, that men are not aſhamed to paſſe thorow it at noone day; and without bluſhing to iuſtifie their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Now what wonder is it if theſe men who entred
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10736:111"/>into their places by bribing, doe in the execution of them liue by extorſion? or that paying for them only for terme of life, more then would purchaſe a fee ſimple of like value, if they tooke no more but due and ordinarie fees, they ſhould take vniuſt courſes to helpe their bargaine, and to keep themſelues from beggerie? Neither is this fault only now to bee found among ſome cunning courtiers, who haue come to their skill by much ſtudy, and long experience; but euen amongſt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates in cities, who are growne more skilful in cunning ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of a bribing match, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their own profeſſions &amp; trades, for learning wherof they haue ſerued ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yeres apprentiſhip.</p>
                     <p>But as there are many forward proficients in this art of bribing, ſo none goeth before many lawyers of theſe times;<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>5.</hi> None goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers in the art of bribing.</note> who in reſpect of their skill and deepe reach into theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked myſteries, may iuſtlie deſerue to be eſteemed not only Maſters of this art, but euen Doctors and profeſſors. For what matter is ſo foule and vniuſt, which many of them will not countenance and defend for an extraordinarie reward? what title ſo ſtrong and cleare, which they are not readie to vndermine and ouerthrow for the gaining of an ample bribe? Neither are the lay eſtate and common-wealths alone tainted with this corruption, but the infection of this vice hath corrupted the Church likewiſe. For if wee looke into the ſchooles of the Prophets, the ſeminaries of learning and religion, we ſhall find that the preferments which by the founders of Colledges were deſtinated and appropriated to thoſe who were pooreſt in purſe, moſt deſtitute of friends, and worthieſt in gifts, both of pietie and learning; are now ſometimes conferred vpon ſuch, as are able to make moſt friends by gifts and rewards, though altogether vnfit and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthie of them. So likewiſe the preferments of the Church are in theſe times by the ſame meanes compaſſed in many places; for theeues and intruders enter the Church dore by the helpe of theſe golden picklockes. Neither is it now any great furtherance to the obtaining of Church preferments, that a man by laborious ſtudie hath attained vnto depth of learning and eminencie of gifts; for though his head be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo full fraught with knowledge, yet if his hands be emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10736:112"/>of bribes, he may haue leaue to ſtand without doores; and though he haue the tongue of the learned, yet he ſhall neuer perſwade his greedie patrone, vnleſſe he can make golden verſes, and mooue him to hearken with a ſiluer ſounding voice. Yea in truth learning in theſe times is accidentally an hinderance to the obtaining the rewards of learning: for if that monie were ſaued which is laid out vpon bookes and candles, and beſtowed in gifts and bribes; and if that time were ſpent in laying cunning plots, for the procuring of preferments, which is beſtowed in making men worthie to bee preferred; it would prooue a farre readier and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier courſe, to compaſſe theſe perferments; though in the meane while they ſhould bee barbarouſlie ignorant, and thereby fitter to deſtroy the Church then to build it, to betray it into the power of the ſpirituall wolfe, then to defend or deliuer it. Whereby it appeareth, that almoſt all ſtates in all places, are exceedingly corrupted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered with this vice of bribing, ſo as in theſe times wee may make that bold and generall challenge:</p>
                     <q>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the preferments of honor onely attained vnto by theſe bribing courſes, but alſo the preferments of wealth and riches: for as the cunning fiſher baiteth his hooke with a ſmall fiſh to get a greater, ſo the onely courſe in theſe daies to compaſſe greater wealth, is to venture that which wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie haue, to bring our ſtate to a low ebbe when we would hopefullie expect a full ſea, and to impoueriſh our ſelues with giuing bribes, when wee deſire to bee aduanced to the greateſt riches.</p>

Sect. <hi>2.</hi> The maniſold briberie of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers lawyers.</note> for I doe not accuſe all, nor any, whoſe conſciences doe not accuſe them; and I know that there are many of this honourable profeſſion who doe truely feare God, loue iuſtice, hate the corruptions of the time, and make conſcience of their waies; but I only taxe ſuch, as being wholly poſſeſſed and corrupted with greedy couetouſneſſe, ſtand accuſed and conuinced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God by the teſtimonie of their own conſciences of theſe griping courſes, and of this vnconſcionable bribing, whereby they ſpoile whole families, and lay waſt dwelling houſes as deſert places; for when men come vnto them for helpe, to maintaine their iuſt titles, and to enter or keepe them in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of their right, they of all others moſt wrong them; and if at al they preſerue their ſtate, it is that themſelues may pray vpon it; vſing herein their clients as the briers the ſheepe, who when he commeth amongſt them for ſhelter againſt the ſtorme, is ſo inueigled, that before hee can get out, he muſt leaue his coate behind him. Neither is this the caſe of the one client alone, but herein both aduerſe parties doe well agree; for oftentimes both he that doth and receiueth the wrong, he that hath a iuſt title vnto that for which he ſueth, as well as he that deteineth other mens rights from the true owners, haue through tedious ſuits their eſtates brought into ſuch deepe conſumptions, that they neuer recouer of it. So as it had bin much better oftentimes to haue giuen away their right, then to haue ſued for it; becauſe they can haue no end of their chargeable ſuites, till hauing ſpent all, their pouertie procureth a priuiledge of exemption. In which reſpect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lawyers of our times may be truly ſaid to accord conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as in the fable the kite compounded the ſtrife between the mouſe and the frog, namely, by making a pray of both
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10736:115"/>parties. And thoſe who ſue for their helpe, are like vnto true men, who when they cannot agree about the diuiſion of their goods, either partie deſiring the greater ſhare, commit the matter to be comprimitted and decided by theeues, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelues with the ſpoile of them both: or like vnto the blind and the lame, contending who ſhould haue the oi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter which the one ſpied, and the other tooke vp, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to decide the matter betweene themſelues, did chuſe an arbitratour, who did eate the meate himſelfe, and gaue a ſhell to either partie.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe it is not enough to ſay that they are diſeaſed,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3.</hi> That lawyers diuerſlie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend in this ſinne of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing: <hi>1.</hi> When as they take gifts to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an vniuſt cauſe.</note> vnleſſe we alſo point at the ſore; or to accuſe them of bribing, vnleſſe we alſo ſhew wherein their taking rewards is to bee condemned; we are further to know, that in this regard they principally offend, firſt, when they take gifts for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of an vniuſt cauſe, themſelues knowing before they take it in hand, that it is of this nature and qualitie. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practiſe amongſt many lawyers of theſe times, who care not how bad the cauſe be, ſo the fee be good, nor how emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie the courts be of iuſtice, ſo that their cheſts hereby may be filled with riches. But herein they grieuouſlie ſinne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Iudge, whom by their pernicious eloquence, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable gloſſes, and falſe ſuggeſtions, they labour to blind, that they may ſeduce and miſleade him out of the path of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, into the by-waies of error and vnrighteouſnes. They ſin againſt the aduerſe partie, ioyning their helping hands with ſuch theeues, as would rob them of their right, and ſpoile them of their iuſt poſſeſſions. They ſinne againſt their owne client, either by taking his monie to doe him no good, his cauſe being apparantly euill; or when it is more hidden and intricate, by ſtrengthening him in euill, countenancing him in his bad courſe, and by ſelling vnto him for his fees an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt bargaine, which he hath no more right to buy, then the other to ſell, which one day will be a clogge to his mind, and a corraſiue to his conſcience. And laſtly, they ſinne againſt their owne ſoules, both by ſcraping out the ſigne of one who is an inheritour of Gods kingdome, and by taking vpon them a marke of reprobation and damnation, namely, the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10736:115"/>receiuing of <hi>a reward againſt the innocent:</hi> as it is, Pſal. 15.5.<note place="margin">Pſalm. 15</note> and whileſt <hi>they call good euill, and euill good, wrong right, and right wrong, iuſtifie the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteouſneſſe of the righteous from him,</hi> they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſubiect to a double woe denounced againſt them:<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.20.23.</note> Eſa 5.20.23.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are guiltie of this ſinne of bribing,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4. 2.</hi> By exacting extraordinarie fees for ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie buſineſſe.</note> who exact extraordinarie fees for ordinarie labour, and exceſſiue rewards for ſmall paines to themſelues, and as little profit to their clients. The which is a common fault of theſe times, wherein ſome lawyers ſo much ouerualue their labours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue their worth, that ſcarce ten times ſo much as their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie fee will bring them to the barre, or cauſe them to open their lippes in the behalſe of their client, if they be men of any note. But wee are to know that by the rule of iuſtice, there ought to be a proportion betweene the worke and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, betweene the ſeruice and the wages, reſpect being had of the dignitie and ſtate of the perſon who taketh the paines; and whatſoeuer exceedeth this iuſt proportion is no better then briberie, extorſion, and theft in Gods ſight. Neither muſt this proportion be meaſured according to their owne conceit, which is commonly vnequall and partiall, through ouerweening pride, and bewitching ſelfe-loue, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the lawes of the land, and limitation of the State, whereby all ſuch things are to bee ordered and determined. Beſides, as this taking of exceſſiue fees is bad in it ſelfe, and full of iniuſtice and corruption, ſo is it of worſe conſequence; for if none of worth can bee entertained but at theſe high rates; then thoſe who are of low condition and meane eſtate, are through their neceſſity debarred of their helpe and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; and onely thoſe who abound in wealth, and haue full purſes, haue the benefit of it; whereof it muſt needs follow, that through the great skil and perſwading eloquence which is vſed in the defence of their cauſe who are rich, &amp; through the weake and inſufficient handling of the poore mans cauſe, though neuer ſo iuſt; powerful iniuſtice wil get y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vpper hand oftentimes of weak right, and truth hauing no patrons but her own naked ſimplicitie to maintaine her, againſt the vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10736:116"/>violence of bold eloquence, and cunning inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſurmizes, doth not ſeldome in theſe daies take the foile.</p>
                     <p>But much more doe they offend,<note place="margin">§.

Whereby they greatly iniure their clients, in betraying their cauſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour of patronage, withholding their promiſed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and helpe, when the neceſſitie of the cauſe moſt requireth it: whereof it muſt needs follow, that the aduerſe partie will obtaine an eaſie victorie, when being armed at all points for the incounter, he findeth no aduerſarie in the liſts to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. And alſo hereby they make themſelues guiltie of ſhamefull theft, in that they take thoſe fees, which of right doe not belong vnto them: for the reward is not abſolutely giuen vnto them, but vpon the condition of their beſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the which condition being not performed, they haue no iuſt title vnto the gift; no more then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeruant hath right to his wages, who doth no worke, or ſpendeth his whole time in following his owne buſineſſe.<note place="margin">The cauſes of the former ſin: <hi>1.</hi> The coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes of the lawyer.</note> Now the cauſe hereof principally is their griping couetouſneſſe, which maketh them thinke all the water loſt which runneth beſides their mill; and therefore they greedily vndertake as many buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as are commended vnto them by aſſured hope of large gaine, though it be impoſſible that they ſhould carefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute one of three as the cauſes require. And ſo they not onely emptie their clients purſes of their mony, but alſo their hearts of all comfort, when they find their cauſe betraied by thoſe who ſhould haue defended it; and perceiue to their griefe that theſe broken ſtaues haue failed them, when they moſt relied on them.<note place="margin">

For hauing no hope of entertaining him to ſpeake in his owne cauſe, he putteth
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10736:116"/>into his mouth this golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gagge, to reſtraine him from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king againſt him, in the behalfe of the aduerſe party. Wherin they behaue themſelues like the poore Indians, who offer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the diuels, not becauſe they looke to obtaine from them any good, but becauſe they would reſtraine them from doing them any hurt: ſo theſe not for hope of receiuing any helpe, but to keepe them from hurting their cauſe, fee them with large gifts; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they who in this corrupt ranke are of greateſt fame, are more inriched by their ſilence, then others by their laboured ſpeeches; and haue more and greater fees to keepe them ſitting ſtil and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, then others for trudging to the courts, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the paines.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, they offend by making tedious delaies,<note place="margin">§.

So that in theſe daies the execution of iuſtice is farre vnlike vnto that it was in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 18.14.</note> for then <hi>Iethro</hi> complained that the peoples ſuites were too tediouſly delaied, becauſe they were faine to waite from morning to night to haue their cauſes heard and tried: whereas now a plaine deede, well penned for matter and forme, and ratified by hand and ſeale, may depend in ſuite a yeere or two in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite of the beſt meanes which the wronged plaintiffe can make to right himſelfe. And if there be any great difficultie in the cauſe (as what may not be made difficult which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth in words and phraſes more then in equitie and iuſtice?) then the corrupt lawyers of theſe times take a leaſe of their clients for terme of life, yea ſometimes for three liues ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiuelie, the nephew ending that ſuite which the grandfather began. Yea and oftentimes after all this expenſe of time and monie, the title is neuer the better cleared, but onely weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and pouertie put an end to theſe ſuites which ſtomacke and abundance began. And he who gaineth moſt, ſitteth downe by loſſe, ſeeing in reſpect of his great expenſe it had
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10736:117"/>been much better, both for his ſtate and mind, to haue had a ſpeedie ouerthrow, then ſo tedious a conqueſt. So that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe times is much like to gaming, wherein vnthrifts caſt the dice who ſhall haue one anothers monie; and the lawyers cheſt like the butlers boxe, which in the end recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth all, and maketh both parties to become beggers; for as in both there is equall hope, ſo no more certaintie of deſired ſucceſſe, one vndoing that which another hath done, and ouerruling that as vniuſt, which another hath determined to be iuſt and equall.</p>

Hence it is that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay</hi> matcheth bribing Magiſtrates with theeues,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.23.</note> Eſa. 1.23. <hi>Thy Princes are rebellious and companious of theeues, euery one loueth gifts and followeth after rewards.</hi> Neither in truth is there any difference betweene them, ſauing that theeues rob onely ſome few priuate perſons, but theſe whole countries and Common-wealths; they by plaine force, and theſe by diſguiſed ſubtiltie and vnder colour of law. So the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> compareth them to cunning fowlers, which lay ſnares
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10736:118"/>and make pitfalles to catch men, and their houſes to cages, in which they keepe and ſtore vp that riches which they haue catched and ſeazed vpon by theſe vniuſt courſes,<note place="margin">Ier. 5.26.27.</note> Ierem. 5.26.27. For purpoſely doe ſuch Magiſtrates make lawes, not for maintenance of order, iuſtice, and gouernment; but that they may ſerue as ſnares to intrap men, and that being catched they may redeeme their libertie and impunitie by large gifts. Or if there bee any other made, they vtterly neglect the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, though they bee neuer ſo profitable and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for the good of the Common-wealth, vnleſſe they bring ſome priuate gaine to their owne cheſts.</p>

So hard a thing it is to intertaine vnpartiall iuſtice, when the heart is foreſtalled with rewards, or to walke in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row path of righteouſneſſe, when the eie of iudgement is hoodwinckt with bribes.</p>
                     <p>But this will better appeare,<note place="margin">§.

For how can he freely rebuke ſuch an one for his faults, whom before he hath made priuie to his owne groſſe corruptions? Or what power hath he to draw out the ſword of iuſtice, for the puniſhment of ſin, when as he hath ſuffred his hands to be manacled with bribes?

So the Lord complaineth of the bribing Iudges of Iſrael,<note place="margin">Eſa. 1.23.</note> Eſa. 1.23. <hi>Euerie one loueth gifts, and followeth after rewards; they iudge not the fatherleſſe, neither doth the widowes cauſe come before them.</hi>

                     <p>But if the cauſe of the poore man haue in it any difficultie, then though it be neuer ſo iuſt, yet hee were better to giue it ouer, and ſpare his coſt and ſaue his further labour, then to proſecute his right before a bribing Iudge; for hee ſhall (as the prouerbe is) but caſt the helue after the hatchet, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an endleſſe labyrinth, in which when hee hath long trauailed, he ſhall find himſelfe as farre from his hoped iſſue, as in the firſt houre of his entrance, wanting the golden thread which ſhould guide him in his way. And if in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of his cauſe, for want of counſell hee giueth the leaſt aduantage to his aduerfarie, though it do not concerne the equitie of the matter, but onely the error of the forme,

                     <p>And thus haue I ſhewed how many miſchiefes the bribe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Magiſtrates and Iudges, brings vpon a State,<note place="margin">§.

For as amongſt Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers there are ſome called good, and ſome bad witches; the one curing thoſe diſeaſes which the other hath cauſed, and helping what the other hath hurt; and yet howſoeuer they differ in name, yet in truth they are of one nature; and are both direct witches, who equally labour to enrich Satans kingdome, both with their owne ſoules, and with the ſoules of others who are ſeduced by them: So among bribers, there are ſome, who may be called good in compariſon of others, who take rewards, to right the others wrongs, and releeue thoſe whom others by their vniuſt ſentences haue oppreſſed; notwithſtanding theſe are bribers too, corrupt, vnrighteous, and naught, although not altogether of ſo malignant a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10736:120"/>as the other. For it is as great iniuſtice to inforce a man to buy that which is his owne alreadie, as to giue vnto him that which of right belongeth to another; and hee that goeth thus farre to make iuſtice, which is in her nature free, to become venall, and of a ſlauiſh nature, within a while will be ſo blinded with gifts, that he will not ſticke to ſet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtice alſo to ſale; and as one ſaith: <hi>Qui non erubeſcat dice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>

Howſoeuer it is, it cannot be but great preiudice to the vprightneſſe of a Iudge, and a ſhrewd preſumption of his corruption, when as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth gifts of thoſe who haue ſuites depending before him; for as a wife or maide would incurre the danger of iuſt ſuſpition, of hauing an vncleane heart, who being ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by a fornicator to commit whoredome, ſhould receiue his gifts, although ſhe ſhould denie his ſuite: for howſoeuer in word ſhe refuſe his wicked motion, yet indeed ſhe recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth pledges of his loue: ſo likewiſe are ſuch Iudges not without cauſe to bee ſuſpected, who receiue gifts of thoſe who labour to peruert iudgement; for howſoeuer in outward ſhew, they make profeſſion of integritie, yet in action they receiue the pawnes of vnrighteouſneſſe, which will cauſe them to preiudice the cauſe, and to hault in the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of iuſtice, and to reſpect the perſon of one, more then of another, and the cauſe for the perſons ſake.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">§.

For he that will not ſticke to ſel iuſtice and iniuſtice, will not ſticke to ſet the common-wealth to ſale alſo, and betray it into the hands of the enemie for large gifts, when he doth but get opportunitie, and can doe it ſafely, ſecretly, and without danger. Of this, great <hi>Philip</hi> of Macedon had often experience in his time; and therefore he thought no caſtle ſo impregnable, no fort ſo ſtrong, but
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10736:120"/>that there might be found roome and paſſage for an aſſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with gold to enter into it. But much more doth this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption abound in our times; for who ſeeth not, that it is an vſuall thing in the time of warre (as the prouerbe is) <hi>Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teis haſtis pugnare,</hi> to fight with ſiluer pikes, to vndermine a State with ſiluer pick-axes, and to batter downe the walles of the beſt defenced Citie with theſe golden bullets? Neither do the great Commanders of theſe times vſually bring their forces againſt any countrie or citie, or venture to winne it by inuaſion and aſſault, before they haue firſt made way vnto themſelues by large gifts, and by corrupting bribes haue made a great partie of the aduerſe ſide, or at leaſt ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall men, who may giue them from time to time ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of all affaires of the State, of oportunities to bee vſed, and impediments to be remoued, and who will when occaſion ſerues, betray their countrie, as much as in them lieth, into the enemies hand. And by this meanes more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſacked, and more countries ſubdued, then by force of armes and dint of ſword: yea in truth, ſo doth this bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing corruption infect all States in theſe daies, that were it not that the Princes and gouernors (being taught by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold experience the greatneſſe of this danger) had a moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant eye to foreſee and ſpie out theſe miſchiefes, and a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere hand to puniſh trecherie when it is diſcouered, ſcarce any State would remaine vnſhaken, and vnruined, by theſe corrupt courſes.</p>

For if <hi>Balthaſar</hi> was cut off in Gods wrath for drinking in the veſſels of the Temple, which his predeceſſor <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezer</hi> had vniuſtly brought into his treaſurie; then what ſhall become of them, who haue not onely the moſt part of their plate made of Church-mettall; but alſo haue ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly taken the bread which they eate, and the meate and drinke which they continually feede vpon,<note place="margin">Dan. 5.</note> out of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſtorehouſe? If <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> were ſmitten with preſent death, for keeping backe part of the price which was raiſed out of their owne poſſeſſions, after it was conſecrated to the Churches maintenance; then what death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is due vnto them, who violently rob and ſpoile the Church of her owne reuenues and lawfull right, vnto which God in his word, and good Princes by their lawes haue intitled it; and wherewith others tendring more Gods glorie, and the flouriſhing eſtate of the Church, then their owne particular, haue richly and religiouſly endowed it?</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Nd thus it appeareth that the ſinne of bribing is pernicious both vnto Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>1.</hi> Bribers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of a marke of Gods children.</note> Now in the laſt place it followeth that I ſhew and prooue that as bribers are bad vnto all others, ſo they are worſt of all to themſelues, in reſpect of the manifold euils which they bring vpon their owne heads: for firſt, as they depriue themſelues of a notable ſigne of the child of God, who ſhall dwell in his holy mountaine, and be an inheritour of the kingdome of heauen, which is, <hi>not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue rewards againſt the innocent;</hi>

                        <hi>A wicked man taketh a gift out of the boſome, to wrest the waies of iudgement.</hi>

                     </p>

                        <hi>and peruerteth the words of the righteous.</hi> So Deut. 16.19.</p>
                     <p>Thirdlie, if a man ſuffer himſelfe to be corrupted and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaied with gifts and rewards; though in his owne nature he be of neuer ſo generous and free a ſpirit, yet in ſhort time it

                        <hi>To haue reſpect of perſons is not good; for that man will tranſgreſſe for a peece of bread.</hi> And the Lord accuſeth the rulers of Ieruſalem, not onely for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting iudgement, but alſo that they were baſe and ſordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous in their bribing, polluting Gods name by their iniuſtice <hi>for handfuls of barlie and peeces of bread,</hi> Ezech. 13.19.<note place="margin">Ezech. 13.19.</note> In which reſpect ſuch corrupt Iudges are fitly compared to a paire of ſcoles, which when they ſeeme moſt equall, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to either ſide by the addition of the leaſt waight, and turne againe to the contrarie ſide, when that waight is ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſed with a greater.</p>

And hence it is that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſophers though they did not perceiue how much the bright ſhining beames of our reaſon, and the vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of the ſoule, were dimmed and darkened with the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10736:128"/>foggie miſts of originall ſinne, but highly extolled with ouer partiall prayſes, the excellencie &amp; perfection of them, yet they plainely diſcerned the great corruption of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered affections, inſomuch that ſome of them being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwayed with too great vehemencie of affection in ſpeaking againſt the affections, haue condemned them as ſimply, and in their owne nature euill, and therefore wholy to bee abandoned, ſeeing there was no hope they ſhould be amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: others with a more iudiciall inſight diſcerning between the things themſelues and their corruption, haue written whole tractates for the reforming of them, eſteeming the chiefe toppe and perfection of wiſedome to conſiſt in the well gouerning and ordering of theſe diſordered and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous paſsions.</p>
                     <p>If then the heathen Philoſophers walking in the darke night of ignorance and errour, and illightened onely with a ſmall glimmering ſparke of naturall reaſon, could thereby both diſcerne their corrupt affections, and alſo did ſtudie to reforme and bring them vnder the rule of reaſon, how much more earneſtly ſhould we endeauour not ſo much to marſhall them vnder the conduct of naturall reaſon, which is it ſelfe but a blind leader, as to reforme and purge them by the word of God, which like a glorious ſhining Sunne, hath diſpelled the foggie miſts of ignorance and errour, and ſo diſcouered all the ſpots and deformities of them, farre more clearely then our blinde reaſon.</p>
                     <p>And as we are earneſtly to labour for the reforming of all the affections, ſo moſt earneſtly of al this of anger, which of all other is moſt turbulent and violent if it be not bridled and reſtrayned. And for our better furtherance in ſo good an endeauour, I haue made choice of this text, to the end I might ſhew how farre forth anger is to be approoued and imbraced, &amp; in what reſpect it is to be auoided &amp; ſhunned. In handling whereof I wil firſt ſhew the meaning of the words, and afterwards intreate of their ſeuerall parts.</p>
                     <p>In ſhewing the meaning of the words I will firſt define
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10736:128"/>what anger is, and then ſet downe the diuers ſorts thereof.<note place="margin">What anger is in generall.</note> Anger therefore generally conſidered, is thus defined: it is an affection, whereby the bloud about the heart being heated, by the apprehenſion of ſome iniury offered to a mans ſelfe or his friends, and that in truth, or in his opinion onely, the appetite is ſtirred vp to take reuenge.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, wee will ſpeake of the thing defined,<note place="margin">The names of anger with the notation.</note> and after of the definition. Anger in the Latine tongue is called <hi>(Ira)</hi> which name hath his notation from the effect, for when by the apprehenſion of an iniury, the heart is inflamed with the heate of anger, it doth make a man <hi>(quaſi ex ſe ire) as it were to goe out of himſelfe,</hi> and in this reſpect hee who was angry, was ſaid by an vſuall Latine phraſe <hi>(non eſſe apud ſe) not to be with himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>ad ſe redijſſe, to haue returned to himſelfe,</hi> when his anger was paſſed ouer. The <hi>Grecians</hi> did eſpecially vſe two names to expreſſe this affection, which did containe in them the very nature of Anger. The firſt <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which ſignifieth the perturbation it ſelfe, or the heating of the bloud by the apprehenſion of the iniurie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: the other <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> which ſignifieth the appetite or deſire of reuenge, which followeth the perturbation. So that theſe two names containe in them, both the materiall and formall cauſe of anger: for the materiall cauſe is the heating of the bloud about the heart, which is ſignified by the firſt name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>: the formall cauſe is the appetite or deſire of reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the iniury offered, which is vnderſtood by the other name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</p>
                     <p>The moſt vſuall name vſed by the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> to ſignifie anger is <hi>Aph,</hi> which ſignifieth alſo the Noſe, and by a ſynec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche the whole face: which name is giuen vnto it eyther becauſe in a mans anger the breath doth more vehemently and often iſſue out of the noſe, which is as it were the ſmoke iſſuing from the flame kindled about the heart, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the face anger is ſooneſt diſcerned, by the often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and change of colours.</p>
                     <p>Our Engliſh word anger is deriued from the latine word
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10736:129"/>
                        <hi>Angor,</hi> which either ſignifieth throtling and choking, or vexation and griefe, becauſe anger worketh both theſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects if it be immoderate: for it ſtops the throate leauing no paſſage for words, and it vexeth and tormenteth both the body and the minde.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much for the name:<note place="margin">The definition explaned.</note> now wee will ſpeake of the definition. Firſt I ſay it is an affection, for the whole eſſence of a man conſiſteth of theſe three things, body, ſoule, and affections, which doe participate of both the other: now anger cannot bee ſaid to bee a qualitie or propertie of the ſoule alone, for the materiall cauſe thereof is the boyling of the bloud about the hart, nor of the body alone, for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall cauſe, namely the appetite and deſire of reuenge ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the apprehenſion of the iniurie offered, doth more properly belong to the ſoule, and therefore I call it a mixt affection proceeding from them both.</p>
                     <p>I adde the materiall cauſe, namely the heating of the bloud about the hart, which heate or inflamation is cauſed by the apprehenſion of the iniurie offered, or the diſlike which the heart conceiueth of the iniurie apprehended: which is either in truth an iniurie, or but in opinion and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance onely: for anger hath not alwayes a true cauſe, but ſometime fained &amp; imaginary: and this materiall cauſe (namely the heating of the bloud by apprehenſion of the iniurie) the formall cauſe followeth, that is to ſay, an appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite or deſire of reuenge, for before wee deſire to reuenge the iniurie, we firſt apprehend and feele it, which deſire is either iuſt or vniuſt: iuſt, if we be angry for a iuſt cauſe, with thoſe with whom we ought to be angry, after a iuſt maner, obſeruing a fit time, and to a good end: vniuſt, if theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances be not obſerued. Furthermore in this definition the cauſe of anger is expreſſed, namely iniurie offered, (for anger alwayes preſuppoſeth iniury) and the ſubiect thereof which is the hart, as alſo the obiect, to wit, reuenge of the iniurie.</p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:10736:129"/>
                     <p>And ſo much for the generall definition of anger:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. The kindes of anger. Natural anger. Corrupt anger Sanctified anger. The Stoikes confuted.</note> now we are to ſhew the diuers ſorts thereof, or rather the diuers acceptation of the ſame affection. Firſt it is taken for the naturall affection of anger as it was created of God, and had his being in man before the fall. Secondly, as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſince the fall by originall ſinne. Thirdly, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified by Gods ſpirit. We are not therefore with the Stoikes to confound theſe three together, and and without difference to condemne them all: for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer this affection as it is corrupted is moſt turbulent, and of all others moſt pernicious, yet wee are to hould that the naturall affection conſidered, either as it was created by God, or ſo farre forth as it is renewed and ſanctified by Gods ſpirit is iuſt, holy, and lawfull.</p>
                     <p>And this may eaſily be prooued by diuers reaſons:<note place="margin">That the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of anger is in it owne nature lawfull.</note> firſt becauſe it was created by God, and was in man before the fall, and before any euill entred into the world: being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lords owne workmanſhip, which by his owne teſtimonie was approoued to be very good. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.31.</note> and of greater antiquitie then euill it ſelfe, it followeth, that the affection in it owne nature is to be eſteemed as good and lawfull. Secondly, becauſe in many places of the Scriptures it is attributed to God himſelfe,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 18. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.36.</note> 
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>the anger of God is made manifeſt from heauen againſt all impietie.</hi> Ioh. 3.36. <hi>he that beleeueth not in the ſonne ſhall not ſee life, but the anger of God ſhall abide vpon him.</hi> Seeing therefore it is aſcribed vnto God, to whoſe moſt perfect and iuſt nature nothing agreeth but that which is iuſt &amp; holy, it followeth that this affection it ſelfe is ſo to be eſteemed. True it is that neither this nor any other affection is in God if we ſpeake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but onely attributed vnto him, that our weake capacities may better conceiue how he exerciſeth his workes and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſailes toward his creatures: But yet foraſmuch as nothing is attributed &amp; aſcribed vnto him which is not good and iuſt, ſo far forth as it is aſcribed, it euidently ſheweth that anger in it owne nature is not euill.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10736:130"/>
                     <p>Laſtly, this manifeſtly appeareth in that this affection was truely and naturally in our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe as hee was man,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5.</note> as it is euident <hi>Mark.</hi> 3.5. where it is ſaide that hee looked angerly vpon the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſes,</hi> mourning for the hardneſſe of their hearts: ſo likewiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incited with an holy anger, to ſee his Fathers houſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a market, he driueth the buyers and ſellers out of the Temple,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.22.</note> 
                        <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.17. Seeing then Chriſt was angry and yet free from all ſinne, it followeth that Anger in it owne nature is iuſt and holy.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection. 1.</note>But it may be obiected that anger is in many places of the Scriptures condemned and forbidden: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22.</note> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. <hi>He that is angry with his brother vnaduiſedly, is culpable of iudgement,</hi>
                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> I anſwere, that not anger ſimply but vnaduiſed anger is there condemned: and in a word all other places where this affection is forbidden, are to be vnderſtood, not of the affection it ſelfe, as it was created or is renewed by Gods ſpirit, but as it is corrupted and depraued with origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinne: for anger being ſanctified, is not onely iuſt and lawfull, but alſo commendable, profitable, and very neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as being the whetſtone of true fortitude, whereby wee are ſtirred vp and encouraged to maintaine the glory of God, and our owne perſons and ſtates, againſt the impietie and iniuſtice of men. Though anger therefore be but a bad Miſtreſſe to commaund, yet it is a good ſeruant to obey: though it be but an ill Captaine to lead our forces into the field againſt our ſpirituall and temporall enimies, yet it is a good ſouldier ſo long as it ſubiecteth it ſelfe to the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and diſcipline of ſanctified reaſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection. 2.</note>But it is further obiected by the <hi>Stoikes</hi> that anger is a perturbation of the minde and therefore euill. To this I anſwer,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note> that as the perturbation of the minde which is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vpon vniuſt cauſes is alſo vniuſt and euill, ſo that which is cauſed vpon iuſt and neceſſary occaſions is iuſt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable: as for example, when a man ſeeth God diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, Religion diſgraced, wickedneſſe vnpuniſhed; If
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10736:130"/>therefore his minde be perturbed and troubled, this pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is not to be condemned, nay to be commended, and they rather to be condemned who are not ſo troubled. Thus was our Sauiour perturbed when he ſaw Gods houſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Iohn.</hi> 2.17. <hi>and</hi> 11.23. <hi>Nom.</hi> 24.7. <hi>King.</hi> 19.</note> as alſo when hee raiſed vp <hi>Lazarus:</hi> thus was <hi>Phinees</hi> diſturbed and troubled in minde, when he ſaw that ſhameleſſe ſinne of <hi>Zimry</hi> and <hi>Cozby:</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> when reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was contemned, idolatrie erected, and the Lords true Prophets deſtroyed.</p>
                     <p>Though therefore anger be a perturbation of the mind it doth not follow that it is euill, for not the perturbation it ſelfe but the cauſe thereof maketh it good if it be good, and euill if it be euill. <note place="margin" type="runSum">3. Obiection.</note>Furthermore whereas they obiect that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger blindeth and confoundeth reaſon, <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note>I anſwere firſt, that if anger bee temperate and moderate, it doth ſeruiceably waite vpon reaſon, and not imperiouſly ouer rule it: and rather maketh a man more conſtant and reſolute in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the path of truth, which hee hath diſcryed with the eie of a cleare iudgement, then any wayes dazell or offend the ſight whereby hee ſhould be cauſed to ſtumble in the way, or elſe turne aſide into by pathes of error.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, though it ſhould be graunted that for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Reaſon is ſomewhat diſturbed with the paſsion, it doth not follow that it is euill or vnprofitable, for before the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is inflamed, the reaſon apprehendeth and iudgeth of the iniury, and ſo as it were firſt kindleth the flame, which being kindled, doth for the inſtant perturbe the minde, but the perturbation being quickly ouer paſſed and the minde quieted, Reaſon is made no leſſe fit thereby to iudge of the iniury, and much more fit to reuenge it. And therefore moderate and ſanctified anger is ſo farre from hurting and hindering the iudgement of Reaſon, that it rather ſeruicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly aydeth and ſupporteth it, by inciting and incouraging it couragiouſly to execute that which Reaſon hath iuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed and reſolued: as therefore the moſt precious eye-ſalue doth preſently after it is put into the eye dim and dazell
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10736:131"/>the ſight, but afterwards cauſeth it to ſee much more cleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: ſo this affection of moderate and holy anger doth at the firſt ſomewhat perturbe reaſon, but afterward it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it much more actiue in executing and performing all good deſignes. And ſo much for the lawfulneſſe of Anger, both in reſpect of the firſt creation thereof, and as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, as alſo concerning the diuers ſorts of Anger.</p>
                     <p>Now in the next place we are to conſider which of theſe is commanded or forbidden in my text.<note place="margin">What anger is commaunded and what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> Firſt for the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it was created by God, howſoeuer it was iuſt and holy in it ſelfe, yet now the beauty and excellency thereof is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced with the foule ſpots of originall ſinne, ſo that there remaine onely ſome reliques of the perfection wherein it was created, till it be againe renewed and reſtored by Gods ſanctifying ſpirit. This therefore is not here commanded or forbidden, but onely that we labour aſmuch as may bee, that it may come neare his former excellencie. The other two ſorts, namely, corrupt and ſanctified anger, the one in theſe wordes is commanded, the other forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Theſe words therefore may be deuided into two gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts.<note place="margin">The generall diuiſion.</note> The firſt an exhortation or commaundement, wherein iuſt and holy anger is inioyned or commended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs in the firſt words <hi>(Be angry,)</hi> the ſecond a prohibition or dehortation from vniuſt, and corrupt anger in the next words <hi>(but ſinne not,)</hi> and becauſe by reaſon of our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are prone to fall into it, the Apoſtle in the words following limiteth and reſtrayneth it to a ſhort time, leaſt it ſhould turne into mallice. <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe, &amp;c.</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, though through infirmitie ye fall into raſh and vnaduiſed anger, yet continue not in your ſin. <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe on your wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The moſt of our new interpreters thinke that the firſt words are rather a permiſsion then a precept,<note place="margin">That iuſt anger is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded.</note> and therefore to be vnderſtood thus. <hi>If you be angry, ſinne not;</hi> or thus, <hi>Are you angry? ſinne not:</hi> that is, though through infirmity yee

                     <p>And the like abuſe there is of our anger towards others: men are ſoone ſtirred vp to choller againſt their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, vpon euery ſlight occaſion and ſhew of iniury offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to themſelues, though it be but an vnkinde word, or a miſtaken ſpeach, or but a ſtrange countenance, but when God is diſhonoured, his name blaſphemed, his religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided his Sabaths prophaned, his whole worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice contemned, they can looke vpon the offenders with a ſmiling countenance and ſo confirme them in their ſinne, or if they be angry, they will eyther not be ſeene in it at all, or elſe they will ſhew it after ſo cold a manner that it ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10736:133"/>hardly be diſcerned.

For though wee are to be angry at, yea, to hate the vices of men, yet we are to loue their perſons, and in the middeſt of our anger, to ſeek their good, eſpecially the ſaluation of their ſoules, &amp; in regard hereof, we ought to grieue more for their ſin, then for the iniuries which by their ſins they haue offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs: and thus was holy <hi>Dauid</hi> affected, whoſe zeale did euen conſume him, becauſe his enimies had forgotten the word of the Lord.<note place="margin">

Here therefore wee muſt auoyde two extreames, the one to hate the perſon for the ſinnes ſake: the other to loue the ſinne for the perſons ſake: for as we would condemne his folly who would loath an exquiſite picture, becauſe it had a ſpot of dirt vpon it, or his that ſhould ſo extreamely dote vpon the rare work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of ſo excellent a feature, that hee alſo would be in loue with the dirt for the pictures ſake, &amp; on the other ſide, commend his wiſdome who ſhould ſo like the picture, as in the mean time he diſliketh of the deformity.

But the practiſe of the world is far otherwiſe: for men will hardly bee friend to the perſon, but they will be a friend to the ſinne alſo, nor an enimie to the ſin, but they wil with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maligne the perſon; or elſe that which is worſe, they will hate the perſon of their neighbour and loue his vice.</p>

                     <p>And theſe are the things required in iuſt and holy anger, which if we obſerue, our anger will be not onely lawfull but alſo neceſſary, both for the ſetting forth of the glory of God, and alſo for the good of our ſelues and of our neighbours.</p>

It is forbidden alſo in the ſixt commaundement vnder the name of murther; both be cauſe it is the chiefe meanes and cauſe which moueth men therevnto, as alſo becauſe it is the murther of the hart, and therfore murther in truth in Gods ſight, who more reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the hart then the hands, for a man may be innocent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, though his hands haue ſlaine his neighbour, if his hart haue not conſented therevnto, as appeareth in the old

                           <hi>Can.</hi> 8.6</note> for there was neuer any loue ſo hartie and entire but anger hath ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued it. The Father in his anger forgetteth his loue to his child, and the child to his father, the husband to his wife, the wife to her husband, and cauſeth them in ſtead of duties of loue to bring forth the fruits of hatred: yea it maketh a man to forget the loue of himſelf, as appeareth by thoſe men who to ſatisfie their anger, violently thruſt themſelues into immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dangers of death. Nay, it maketh a man offer raging vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence againſt ſuch a friend as is more deare to him then his own life, as it is euident in the example of <hi>Alexander,</hi> who in his anger ſlew his friend <hi>Clitus,</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he loued ſo entirely that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10736:139"/>he needs would haue reuenged his murther by putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a wilfull death. As therefore we cannot diſcerne the heat of the Sunne, when we are neare vnto a ſcorching fire, ſo the heauenly heate of diuine loue is not felt, if the furious flame of anger be kindled in our harts. Couetouſnes alſo is a moſt violent and ſtrong vice, which nothing almoſt can vanquiſh but death, and they who are poſſeſſed therewith do loue their riches better then their owne liues, as we may fee in their example, who being depriued of them murther themſelues; yea they are more deare vnto them then the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their owne ſoules, as may appeare by thoſe who fall into outragious ſinnes, whereby they plunge their ſoules headlong into hell, that they may get momentarie riches; &amp; by them alſo who deſpiſe the meanes of their ſaluation in compariſon of a ſmall worldly trifle: and yet anger being once admitted doth ouercome couetouſnes, as it is euident in the example of them, who to ſatisfie their furious anger by the death of their enimie, are content to forfeit their goods though they be neuer ſo couetous; beſides the double hazard of their liues which they incur, both in their priuate quarrell, and in ſatisfying by deſerued puniſhment publike iuſtice. The like alſo may be ſaid of them, who by anger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incited to reuenge, are content to ſpend all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by proſecuting wrangling ſuites in Law, of little or no importance, to the end they may impoueriſh him alſo with whom they are offended; and ſo are content to pull the houſe vpon their owne heads, that they may ouerwhelm another vnder the vvaight of the ſame ruine.</p>
                     <p>Feare alſo is an affection of no ſmall force and violence: for oftentimes it compelleth men to thruſt themſelues into imminent dangers that they may auoyde dangers, and to kill themſelues for feare of greater torments: and yet an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vanquiſheth feare, many times cauſing them who would tremble to ſee anothers vvound, contemne their owne death, and ſo turneth the moſt cowardly feare into moſt deſperate rage and furious reſolution.</p>

                     <p>For the firſt.<note place="margin">The definition of vniuſt anger.</note> Vniuſt anger is a wrongfull and an vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable deſire of reuenge, ſtirred vp in vs by vniuſt cauſes, whereby we hauing no reſpect of the glory of God, nor the good of our ſelues or our brethren, are after an vniuſt &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate manner, angry with them with whom we ought not to be angry. That vniuſt anger is a deſire of reuenge,<note place="margin">Anger an vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable deſire of reuenge.</note> it is ſo euident that it needeth no proofe: for we know by daily experience, that he who is prouoked vnto anger by an iniury offered in truth or in his opinion, deſireth reuenge accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of the iniury receiued, or the opinion which he hath conceiued of it. If he be iniured by a ſcornful looke he ſeeketh to reuenge it with a diſdainfull countenance: if by words he reuengeth by words; if in deeds he deſireth to reuenge by deeds; yea oftentimes the fury of anger caſting a miſt before the ſight of reaſon, cauſeth ſmal iniuries to ſeem great, &amp; according to that falſe opinion, inciteth men to take reuenge without all proportion. For an angry looke with angry words, for angry words with blowes, and for blowes with death, according to the violence of the affection, and not the qualitie of the iniury receiued.</p>
                     <p>Now that this deſire of reuenge is vniuſt and vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> it appeareth by that which followeth in the definition.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10736:140"/>And firſt becauſe the cauſes thereof are vniuſt.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes of vniuſt anger are eyther internall or exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.<note place="margin">The cauſes of vniuſt anger. 1. Internall. 1. Selfe loue</note> The internall cauſes are diuers, as firſt, ſelfe loue, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we ſo immoderately loue our ſelues, that we neuer thinke of the iniuries &amp; indignities which we offer others, or els ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to bee none; or els lightly eſteeme of them, as not worthy the recitall; but on the other ſide, it maketh men hainouſly aggrauate iniuries offered vnto themſelues: and ſo to make huge mountaines of ſmall molehils; it cauſeth the heart eaſily to apprehend the wrong, buſie in meditating of it being apprehended, eager in ſeeking reuenge after me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, and the hand no leſſe forward in acting thoſe tragedyes which the heart hath inuented. For by ſelfe loue men are induced to thinke themſelues worthy of al loue and honour, and therefore if a ſmall iniury be offered vnto them, they ſuppoſe that death is too ſmall a reuenge for ſo great an indignitie offered to ſuch worthy perſonages. Yea, if they be not ſo much reſpected as their hautie ambition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, or if others be preferred before them, and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruedly, this is matter enough to prouoke them to furious rage, not onely againſt them of whom they are not regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but them alſo who are preferred in others iudgement. And this is euident in the example of <hi>Caine,</hi> who becauſe God reſpected the offering of <hi>Abell</hi> more then his,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> was incenſed to wrath, and had his anger ſo inflamed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could quench it but the bloud of his deare brother; and in <hi>Saul</hi> who could with no patience endure, that the praiſes of <hi>Dauid</hi> ſhould ſurmount his in the ſight and audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the people,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.8</note> but was enraged with deadly anger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, who for his merits deſerued to be aduanced.</p>
                     <p>And thus doth ſelfe loue make a man winck at thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuryes which he offereth others, and to put on the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of affection when he looketh on thoſe wrongs which are offered to himſelfe, whereby it commeth to paſſe that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſmall iniurie ſeemeth great and prouoketh to great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Whereas if we thought meanly of our ſelues and loued

                     <p>The ſecond internall cauſe of vniuſt anger is pride and arrogancy of ſpirit, which is a fruite of ſelfe loue;<note place="margin">

The reaſon hereof is apparant: proude men being iealous of their honour and reputation, are alſo very ſuſpicious of contempt, ſo that the leaſt iniurie prouoketh them to choller and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine, becauſe they are ready to imagine that thereby they are expoſed to contempt.

                        </note> the cauſe of our anger is vniuſt, when it is onely imaginary, hauing no other ground but our owne ſuſpition.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10736:143"/>for want of loue cauſeth men to interpret the actions of others in the worſt ſenſe, and vpon their falſe ſurmiſes they ground their anger. One is angry becauſe ſaluting his neighbour, hee did not reſalute him, whereas perhaps he did not ſee him, or at the leaſt hauing his minde other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe occupied did not obſerue him: another is offended if any in his company is merry, thinking that hee maketh himſelfe ſport with his infirmities; another becauſe hee is too ſad, imagining that it is becauſe his company diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him. In a word as mens ſurmiſes are innumerable, ſo alſo are the cauſes of vniuſt anger. Yea ſo prone men are to inuent cauſes where none is, that oftentimes they are ſore diſpleaſed becauſe they haue receiued ſmall benefits not anſwerable to their expectation, or not equall to thoſe which they ſee beſtowed vpon others; and ſo they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger with ſmall gifts, as though they had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued great iniuries, but let vs be aſhamed of ſuch follie and learne to leaue it. Hath thy friend giuen more to another then thee? why it may bee hee hath deferued more, and though hee hath not, yet that which thou haſt receiued might content thee if thou wouldſt make no compariſons. <hi>Nunquam erit foelix quem torquebit foelicior,</hi>

                        </note> hee will neuer be happie who is vexed when he ſeeth one more happie.

Loue couereth a multitude of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10736:144"/>ſinnes. <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.12. they therefore who rather finde cauſes where they are not, then couer them where they are, doe plainly ſhew their want of loue, and their too great prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to anger, it is the nature of loue to make great faultes ſeeme little, and little faultes none at all: but anger ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth euery ſmall ſlip a capitall offence. and euery word of diſgrace worthie a ſtabbe. And as when wee behould the Sunne riſing through thicke and foggie vapours, we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it to bee of a farre greater quantitie then when the ayre is pure and cleare: ſo when the ſoggie miſts of anger doe ouerſhadow reaſon, we ſuppoſe euery fault to be grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then it would appeare if this turbulent affection were diſpelled with the liuely heate of ardent loue.</p>
                     <p>Some are angry at the imperfections of nature, which being not in the parties power to amend, ſhould rather moue compaſsion then prouoke anger.

And therefore theſe ſmall trifling errours whereinto wee fall for want of knowledge, will in them rather moue laughter, or at leaſt pittie, then prouoke anger. For as the vnhappie ſpeaches and ſhrewd turnes of little children are excuſed becauſe they proceed from want of wit; ſo ſhould the ſame excuſe ſerue for them who commit faults through ignorance and ſimplicitie.</p>

                     <p>So alſo our anger is immoderate when we haue no reſpect of the partie with whom wee are angry; as when the ſonne being prouoked to anger againſt his father, though it be for a iuſt cauſe, doth not vſe him with that reſpect and reuerence which becommeth him, but burſteth out into vndutifull and inſolent ſpeeches: quite contrarie to the example of <hi>Iacob,</hi> who being but a ſonne in law did not in his anger forget his dutie, but vſed all diſcretion and moderation: Gen. 31.36. And of <hi>Ionathan,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 31.36.</note> who though he had iuſt cauſe to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie with his father <hi>Saul,</hi> yet he onely ſhewed it by riſing from the table and departing:<note place="margin">1.

And the like may be ſaid of the ſeruants anger towards his maſter, the ſubiects towards the Magiſtrate, and of all inferiors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their ſuperiors. For howſoeuer the law of God bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs, to be angrie when iuſt cauſe is offred, yet it alſo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to moderation and diſcretion: For it is the author of order and not confuſion.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond propertie of vniuſt anger,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> The ſecond propertie of vniuſt anger is in reſpect of the obiect.</note> is in reſpect of the obiect; for whereas iuſt anger oppoſeth it ſelfe only againſt ſinne and iniuſtice, vniuſt anger is incenſed againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the offender, yea oftentimes of them who are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, nay becauſe they are innocent, as appeareth by thoſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10736:145"/>examples which before I rehearſed. But if we will be Chriſts Diſciples, wee muſt follow his doctrine and example.<note place="margin">Matth. 5 44.</note> His doctrine, Math. 5.44. <hi>Loue your enemies, doe good to thoſe that hate you, &amp;c. That you may be the ſonnes of your father which is in heauen.</hi> Where he plainly intimateth, that they are not the ſonnes of God, who doe not loue the perſons of their verie enemies: we muſt follow alſo his example, who pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his enemies euen while he was vpon the croſſe ſubiect to their outragious iniuries: Luk. 23.34.<note place="margin">Luk. 23.34. Act. 7.66.</note> Which bleſſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident holy <hi>Stephen</hi> imitated: Act. 7.66.</p>
                     <p>But many are not onely incenſed againſt the perſons of their enemies who are men like vnto themſelues, but alſo with brute beaſts, which are not capable thereof, as wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Balaam,</hi> Num. 24.10.<note place="margin">Num. 24.10.</note> Yea euen with things which want both ſenſe and life: and ſo was <hi>Xerxes</hi> angry with the riuers,<note place="margin">Plutarch. de cobib. iracun.</note> and ſent letters full of mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing threatnings to the hils. And manie ſuch are ſubiect to continuall view, who if any thing in their hands diſpleaſe them, will not ſticke to daſh it againſt the ground, though after, they are faine to take it vp againe: or to ſpoile and breake it in peeces, though afterwards they muſt be glad to beſtow great labour in repairing that which by greater folly they haue defaced. But theſe men may fitly bee compared vnto children, who hauing gotten a fall beate the earth; ſo they hauing receiued ſome hurt through their owne folly or negligence, are angry with thoſe things which are ruled by them as bare inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>The laſt propertie of vniuſt anger reſpecteth the time,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3.</hi>
                        </note> when as it being long retained becommeth hatred. And this happeneth not onely when men are prouoked vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon waightie cauſes, but alſo when it is grounded on the moſt ſlight occaſions: for when vaine trifles haue ſtirred them vp to wrath they perſeuere in it, leſt they might ſeem to haue begun without cauſe, and ſo againſt all reaſon the vniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of their anger makes them perſiſt in it with greater ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie. For therefore they retaine it, yea increaſe it, that the greatneſſe of their anger may make men beleeue that it could not chuſe, but ariſe from ſome waightie occaſion and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10736:146"/>iuſt cauſe: and ſo they chuſe rather to ſeeme iuſt, then to bee iuſt. But more of this afterwards when I come to ſpeake of the reſtraint of vniuſt anger.</p>

                        </note> Now we are to ſpeake of the kinds thereof. It admitteth of a twofold diſtinction; firſt, it is either hidden and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert, or elſe profeſſed and manifeſt. Hidden anger is of two ſorts;<note place="margin">Hidden anger which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable.</note> the firſt is commendable, when as men labour by all meanes poſſible to ſubdue the affection, and to ſmother the flame after it is kindled that it burſt not foorth into vnſeemely words or actions ſauouring of reuenge. And this is a fruit of the ſpirit, which when it cannot repell anger and keepe it from entrance; in the next place it endeuoureth to expell and repreſſe it.</p>
                     <p>The other ſort of hidden anger is to be condemned,<note place="margin">Hidden anger which is to be condemned.</note> when as men nouriſhing it in the heart doe notwithſtanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, that they may haue the better opportunitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, which they are purpoſed to ſeeke with ſuch a full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that they refuſe all parly, leſt they might be brought to a truce, or conclude a peace. This anger is farre worſe then that which is profeſſed, both in reſpect of the party who is angrie, and the other with whom hee is angrie. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the partie himſelfe, becauſe containing in him this turbulent affection, it doth vexe and torment him, like a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging fire which hath no paſſage, or a violent ſtreame whoſe current is ſtopped. And hereof it is that anger is ſaid to be of the vipers brood, becauſe it pineth and conſumeth him in whom it is bred. In reſpect of him alſo with whom hee is angrie, becauſe it maketh him leſſe warie in preuenting his malice, and therefore the more eaſilie ſurpriſed. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard whereof a ſecret enemie is more dangerous then one who profeſſeth his emnitie: for as a ſmall companie of men
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10736:146"/>lying in an ambuſhment, will more eaſily ouercome a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter force, then if they ſhould march againſt them with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners diſplaied: ſo a weake enemie hiding his anger, and watching his beſt opportunitie of reuenge, is more like to circumuent and ſurpriſe one more mightie then himſelfe, then if he ſhould profeſſe his malice.</p>
                     <p>Examples hereof wee haue in the Scriptures:<note place="margin">Examples.</note> as in the old ſerpent, who cloaked extreme malice vnder goodlie words and faire promiſes, profeſſing himſelfe a kind friend to our firſt parents, when he whollie intended their eternall deſtruction: Gen. 3.1. &amp;c. As alſo in <hi>Cain,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 3.1.</note> who talked fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly with his brother as in times paſt, when as hee alreadie had reſolued his murther in his heart, which alſo preſently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he acted with his hands: Gen. 4.8.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.8.</note> So <hi>Abſolon</hi> like a cunning courtier concealed deadly malice two yeeres toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againſt his brother <hi>Ammon;</hi> to the end that being not ſuſpected, he might obtaine the more fit opportunitie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: 2. Sam. 13.22.23. The like example we haue in <hi>Ioab,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2. Sam. 13.22.23.</note> who kindly ſaluting <hi>Amaſa,</hi> cruelly ſtabbed him while hee louinglie embraced him: 2. Sam. 20.9.<note place="margin">2. Sam. 20.9. Luk. 22.47.</note> As alſo in the traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> who betraied his maſter while hee kiſſed him: Luk. 22.47. Neither is our age fruitfull in all ſin, barraine of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: for how many Italionate machiauellians liue among vs, who will not ſtick to giue moſt kind congeis with hand, cap and knee to them from whom they are moſt enſtranged in their hearts; and looke moſt ſmoothly vpon them againſt whom they haue conceiued deepeſt malice? So that their anger is like vnto riuers which are moſt dangerouſly deep, where the ſtreame runneth ſtilleſt and ſmootheſt. If you aske theſe men the reaſon hereof, they will tell you, that (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of their maſter Machiauel) <hi>Profeſſa perdunt odia vindictae locum:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Senec. in Medea.</note> Profeſſed anger taketh away opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of reuenge. But let vs know, that as in malice, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling thereof, they are like vnto the diuell himſelfe, ſo without repentance they ſhall be like to him in puniſhment. And ſo much for hidden anger.</p>
                     <p>Profeſſed anger is to be ſeene when either men of ſet pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe do neglect the ſignes and duties of loue,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2.</hi> Profeſſed anger two ſold.</note> or elſe in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10736:147"/>and bringing foorth the fruits of anger.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> Sullen or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent anger.</note> For the firſt, ſome in their anger are ſullenlie ſilent from day to day, and moneth to moneth, not vouchſafing to ſpeake a word to thoſe with whom they are diſpleaſed, though they daily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with them; as though with their loue and charitie they had loſt their tongues alſo. But ſuch men forget the end why God gaue them a tongue, that is, that it might be not onelie an holy organe to ſing our Creators praiſe, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that we might be enabled thereby to conuerſe more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly and louinglie one with another; as alſo that thereby we might preſerue this loue begun by taking away all of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; for as the Lord hath giuen a tongue to enquire out an iniurie, as alſo to reprooue and reprehend the offender, ſo he hath giuen the ſame tongue to make a iuſt excuſe for the working of reconciliation. It may be if thou wouldeſt come to expoſtulate the matter with thy neighbour, he would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iuſtly excuſe his fault, or humblie confeſſe it, and deſire pardon, whereas now thou makeſt him thine enemie by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him all meanes and hope of reconciliation: for what hope can he conceiue of peace, ſeeing thou wilt not ſo much as come to a treatie?</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>3. 2.</hi> Anger is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by euil ſpeaking or euill doing. <hi>1.</hi> Euill ſpeaking.</note> profeſſed anger is ſhewed by the manifeſt fruits thereof, and they are of two ſortes, euill ſpeaking and euill doing. By euill ſpeaking, as when men doe manifeſt their anger in ſpightfull railing words which are farre vnbeſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not only a Chriſtian, but alſo an honeſt Infidell. This is condemned in the one and thirtie verſe of this Chapter: <hi>Let all bitterneſſe, anger, and wrath, crying,</hi> (that is, clamorous rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) <hi>and euill ſpeaking be put away from you.</hi> And that we may the rather be mooued to abſtaine from this odious vice, let vs conſider that God made the tongue to bee an inſtrument of his praiſe, and not to diſhonour him by curſed ſpeaking. And therefore he will not hold him guiltleſſe, which makes this heauenly organe of his ſpirit created to ſhew foorth the Creators praiſe, a curſed inſtrument of Satan in reuiling and ſlandring our neighbour. And this our Sauiour Chriſt tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs: <hi>Whoſoeuer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall ſay vnto his brother Raca;</hi> (that is, the leaſt word of reproch) <hi>ſhall be worthie to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10736:147"/>with a councell</hi> (that is,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.22.</note> an aſſemblie or ſenate of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates) <hi>And whoſoeuer ſhall ſay foole, ſhall be puniſhed with hell fire,</hi> Matth. 5.22. Let vs remember, that <hi>by our words we ſhall be iuſtified, and by our words we ſhall be condemned:</hi> and good reaſon, for <hi>Verba ſunt animi indices,</hi> the tongue is the hearts interpreter, and therefore our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.27.34.</note> 
                        <hi>Ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantia cordis os loquitur:</hi> Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh. Yea this the wiſe <hi>Socrates</hi> well knew; and therefore when a certaine father had ſent his ſonne to him, to the end that ſeeing him he might perceiue his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he ſaid to the young man: <hi>Loquere adoleſcens, vt te vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deam,</hi> Speake young man that I may ſee thee: noting thereby that the diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his heart was beſt known by the words of the mouth. Seeing therefore God iudgeth according to the heart, &amp; ſeeing the heart is beſt diſcerned by the tongue, great reaſon it is that by our words we ſhould be iuſtified or condemned. Let vs remember alſo,<note place="margin">Matth. 12.36.</note> that <hi>if for euerie idle word wee muſt giue an account at the day of Iudgement,</hi> how much more for railing and reuiling ſpeeches? and if theſe meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alwaies run in our minds we will in our greateſt anger follow the practiſe of the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſalm. 39.1. that is,<note place="margin">Pſal. 39.1.</note> we will bridle our mouthes that we may not ſin with our tongue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, profeſſed anger is expreſſed by euill doing,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>2.</hi> Euill doing.</note> when either in our anger we offer iniuries or ſeeke reuenge for thoſe which are offered vs; both which are forbidden in the word of God. The firſt, Leuit. 19.13.<note place="margin">Leuit. 19. Pſal. 15.3.</note> Thou ſhall not do thy neighbour wrong: and Pſalm. 15.3. it is ſet downe for a note of an inheritour of Gods kingdome, not to doe euill to our neighbour: and conſequentlie hee that is prouoked by anger to offer iniurie to his brother, can haue no aſſurance without repentance that he is an heire of Gods kingdome. And this may further appeare Matth. 5.22. for if he who v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth reprochfull words bee in danger of hell fire,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.22.</note> what ſhall we thinke of him that goeth further, namely, to wicked deeds? As therefore we tender our ſoules ſaluation, let vs rule our hands, though wee cannot rule our affections.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, it is expreſſed by reuenging iniuries receiued,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10736:148"/>which though it bee not altogether ſo great a ſinne as the other, yet it is alſo condemned and forbidden as no ſmall ſin in the word of God:<note place="margin">Matth. 5.39.</note> Matth. 5.39. <hi>Reſist not euill; but to him who ſmiteth thee on the right cheeke, turne the left alſo, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 12.19.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.19.</note> 
                        <hi>Auenge not your ſelues, for it is written, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine, and I will repay, ſaith the Lord.</hi> And ſo much for the firſt diſtinction of anger.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>4.</hi> A ſecond di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in reſpect of the ſubiect.</note> anger is diſtinguiſhed into three kinds in reſpect of the ſubiect thereof. The firſt is of thoſe who are ſoone an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie and ſoone pleaſed. The ſecond of them who are ſlow to anger, and alſo ſlow in being reconciled. The third of thoſe who are ſoone prouoked to anger, and alſo long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>1.</hi> Haſtie anger.</note> they may not vnfitly bee compared to flaxe which is ſoone kindled and ſet on fire, but ſoone alſo extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, vnleſſe the flame bee continually nouriſhed with new matter: ſo their anger is eaſily inflamed by the leaſt ſparke of occaſion, but ſoone mitigated, vnleſſe it be nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with new prouocations: or their anger may be likened vnto fire in thornes, which maketh a great blaze for the time, and yeeldeth a crackling noiſe, but ſoone goeth out, vnleſſe a new ſupplie of matter bee continually added: ſo they are ſoone inflamed, but when their anger hath a little ſpent it ſelfe in words like the crackling of thornes, it is ſoone quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and pacified.</p>
                     <p>Theſe men in the world are ſaid to haue the beſt natures,<note place="margin">Haſtie natures in the world commended. <hi>Pſal. 103.8.9.</hi>
                        </note> but in truth it is farre otherwiſe. For that nature is beſt which moſt reſembleth God himſelfe, who as he is ſlow to anger, ſo he is readie to forgiue, Pſalm. 103.8.9. If therefore we would in truth haue good natures, we muſt imitate the Lord, that is, be long before we are prouoked to anger, and readie to be reconciled;<note place="margin">Iam. 1.19. Matth. 5.25.</note> to the firſt we are exhorted, Iam. 1.19. <hi>Be ſlow to wrath;</hi> to the latter, Matth. 5.25. <hi>Agree with thine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſarie quicklie,</hi> and that not onelie when thou haſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, but alſo when he hath offered the iniurie vnto thee, and that not once or twice, or till ſeuen times, but vnto ſeuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie times ſeuen times,<note place="margin">Matth. 18.22. §. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5.</note> as our Sauiour exhorteth, Mat. 18.22.</p>
                     <p>But leſt wee ſhould content our ſelues with this nature
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10736:148"/>which of naturall men is thought commendable, let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;<note place="margin">Haſtie anger forbidden.</note> firſt, that it is condemned and forbidden in the word of God. Eccleſ. 7.11. <hi>Be thou not of an haſtie ſpirit is be angrie,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.11.</note> 
                        <hi>for anger reſteth in the boſom of fooles.</hi> Yea our Sauiour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth it as murther in Gods ſight: Mat. 5.22.<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Matth. 5.22.</hi> Haſtineſſe to anger, a fooliſh and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous vice.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we are to conſider, that this haſtines to anger is a fooliſh vice; for as it alwaies beginneth with raſhneſſe, ſo it moſt commonly endeth with repentance; for after the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie man hath iniured his neighbour by vnaduiſed words or iniurious deeds, then he ſheweth himſelfe ſorie for it; and ſo like a fooliſh Surgeon, firſt he breaketh his head and after giues him a plaſter, which though it heale the wound, yet oftentimes it leaues a ſcarre.</p>
                     <p>And yet I ſpeake of the leaſt euils which accompanie raſh anger; for how many haue there been who in their furie haue reuealed their friends ſecrets, more deere vnto them then their owne liues? Yea, how many through this raſh an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger haue violated the perſons, nay murthered them with whom they were lincked in the ſtraiteſt bond of friendſhip? and ſo haue done that in a moment, which they haue with bitterneſſe repented the whole courſe of their liues; then the which, no greater follie can be committed. And therefore it is well ſaid of the wiſe man, Prou. 14.17.<note place="margin">Prou. 14.27. verſ. 29.</note> 
                        <hi>He that is haſtie to anger committeth follie:</hi> and verſ. 29. <hi>Hee that is ſlow to anger is of great wiſedome; but he that is of an haſtie minde, exalteth follie.</hi> And leſt we ſhould thinke that he ſeldome thus offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, he telleth vs,<note place="margin">Prou. 29.22.</note> Prou. 29.22. that <hi>a furious man aboundeth in tranſgreſſion.</hi> Prou. 12.16. Eccleſ. 7.10.</p>

                        </note>But here the cholericke man will alleage for himſelfe, that he is haſtie by nature, and therefore to bee borne with. <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note>I anſwere, that we haue not this nature by creation, for wee were created according to Gods owne image, who is ſlow to anger; but this corruption hath taken hold of vs by reaſon of our originall ſinne; and therefore wee are not to excuſe one ſinne by another, but rather earneſtly to labour that this pollution may bee waſhed away with the water of Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who by his grace doth reforme nature. For thoſe who are regenerate by the holie Ghoſt, though naturally they bee as

                        <note place="margin">Prou. 14.27.</note> as it is, Prou. 14.27. So likewiſe raſh and vnbridled anger, which before regeneration cauſed men to rage againſt the perſon of their neighbour, doth now oppoſe it ſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſinne and vniuſtice only, whereby God is diſhonored and the Church and common-wealth damnified.</p>
                     <p>Do not therfore hereafter excuſe thy furious &amp; raſh anger by alleaging thy nature; for thou mighteſt as wel ſay, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not abſtaine from it, becauſe I am carnall and vnregenerate, as becauſe I am haſtie by nature: for thoſe who haue laid aſide
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10736:149"/>the old man, and are renewed by Gods ſpirit, haue this affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction partly tamed and ſubdued, and partly ſanctified, refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and made fit for neceſſarie &amp; profitable vſes; whereas on the other ſide they that let the raines looſe to this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affection were neuer waſhed with the water of Gods ſpirit, and conſequently while they continue in this ſtate cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen: Ioh. 3.5.<note place="margin">Iohn 3.5.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that we may neuer alleage this vaine excuſe, let vs conſider further, that it is no better then Lazers ragges to couer the deepe feſtred ſores of our corruption; or then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> fig leaues to hide the nakedneſſe of ſinne, which may be as fit a vizour to diſguiſe euen the moſt vglie vices, as this of anger: for nature corrupted prouoketh not onely to raſh anger, but alſo to all outrages. And therefore the murtherer by as great ſhew of reaſon might excuſe his murther, becauſe he is by nature cruell; or the adulterer his adulterie, becauſe he is by nature lecherous; or the theefe his theft, becauſe he is by nature couetous, as the haſtie man his anger becauſe he is by nature cholericke. As therefore if a murtherer or theefe ſhould come before a Iudge, and excuſe his fact by ſaying it was his nature, and therefore he could not chuſe but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; the Iudge would anſwere, that it was his deſtinie alſo that he ſhould be hanged: So when wee ſhall bee arraigned before the Lord chiefe Iuſtice of heauen and earth, the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging of our corrupted nature wil be ſo farre from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing vs, that it alone will bee ſufficient to condemne vs. And ſo much for the firſt ſort of anger which is to be ſeen in angry and cholericke men.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond ſort is of ſuch as are ſlow to anger,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>2. 2.</hi> Anger which is ſlovvly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained but long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> but being incenſed are hardly pacified. And theſe are like vnto more ſolid timber, which is long before it be kindled, but being kindled, continueth long in burning. As theſe are better then the other in reſpect of their ſlowneſſe to wrath, ſo they are farre worſe becauſe they continue in it; for anger retained becommeth hatred, which is an affection farre more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then anger it ſelfe, and much more incorrigible; for as raſh anger is moſt commonly ioyned with repentance, ſo this inueterate anger is alwaies ioyned with perſeuerance in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10736:150"/>euill. And he that is ſubiect thereunto doth not onely fall into ſinne, but alſo is reſolued to continue in it; yea he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth delight therein oft times by meditating on reuenge; as we may ſee in <hi>Eſau,</hi> who was reſolued to retaine his anger againſt <hi>Iacob</hi> till his fathers death, and in the meane time comforted himſelfe by thinking on reuenge:<note place="margin">Gen. 27.41.42:</note> Gen. 27.41.42.</p>
                     <p>But if wee would bee the children of our heauenly father, we muſt reſemble him, not onely in ſlowneſſe to anger, but alſo in ſwiftneſſe to forgiue: and though our brother offend vs ſeuentie times ſeuen times, yet muſt we continually bee readie to imbrace reconciliation:<note place="margin">Mat. 18.22.</note> Matth. 18.22. and ſo wee ſhall not be <hi>ouercome of euill, but ouercome euill with goodneſſe,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.21.</note> Rom. 12.21.

                        <hi>For with what meaſure wee mete, it ſhall bee meaſured vnto vs againe:</hi> Matth. 7.2. And as we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue men their treſpaſſes, ſo will our heauenly father forgiue vs:<note place="margin">

                     <p>The third ſort is of them who are eaſilie prouoked vnto anger, and being prouoked will neuer be reconciled. Theſe men are monſters in nature, and flat oppoſite to the Lord: for whereas he is ſlowe to anger and readie to forgiue, they are moſt ſlowe to forgiue, and moſt prone to anger. This an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger I know not how to expreſſe, nor to what I may compare it, ſeeing naturall things cannot reſemble it, becauſe it is monſtrous and againſt the nature of all things, ſauing man. For the moſt fierce Lions and cruell Tigers haue ſome cauſe which incenſeth them to anger, and ſome meaſure and end of their furie after it is prouoked; and therefore they are far worſe who are angrie without a cauſe, and know not how to make an end. Seeing therefore naturall things are not fit to reſemble them, let vs conſider artificiall. They are like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tinder, which being kindled with the leaſt ſparke, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo retaine the fire till it be conſumed. But herein they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like: the tinder may eaſilie be extinguiſhed; but their anger can by no meanes bee mitigated: the tinder doth but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume it ſelfe, or at the leaſt thoſe things which are neere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; but thoſe that are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them furtheſt diſtant are often
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10736:150"/>ſcorched with the burning heat of their furious paſſion. It is like vnto wild fire, which moſt eaſilie taketh hold of euerie thing, and is moſt hardly quenched: but herin it is farre more violent and pernicious, that whereas wild fire may be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with vinegre or milke, this can be quenched only with blood, yea with the heart blood. There is nothing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the world naturall or artificiall, which doth ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſſe this vile affection; it onely can bee reſembled by the malice of Satan, who for no cauſe maligned God and vs, and yet his malice will neuer haue end. Vnleſſe therfore we would be worſe then all things naturall or artificiall, yea as bad as the diuell himſelfe, wee muſt be either ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or readie to forgiue.</p>

                     <p>It alſo maketh men notablie ſinne againſt the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, by cauſing them through impatience to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curſing and imprecations, ſwearing and blaſpheming the name of God.</p>
                     <p>It cauſeth them alſo grieuouſlie to ſinne againſt the fourth commandement, by making them vnfit for the exerciſes of the Sabbath, as inuocation and hearing of the word, becauſe they who are poſſeſſed therewith haue their minds diſturbed and diſtracted either by thinking vpon the iniurie, or elſe of reuenge. So that there is not one commandement of the firſt table which anger doth not notoriouſlie violate.</p>
                     <p>But as it ouerthroweth the vertues of the firſt table which reſpect pietie, ſo alſo of the ſecond table which reſpect iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:<note place="margin">Jt ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vveth iuſtice and charitie.</note> and firſt of all iuſtice it ſelfe; whoſe generall rule is this, <hi>Vt ſuum cuique tribuatur,</hi> that that bee giuen to euerie one which belongeth to him.

                     <p>It ouerthroweth alſo charitie which is the ſum of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table, whoſe generall rule is this, <hi>That we loue our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our ſelues:</hi> for anger in ſtead of performing any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of loue, cauſeth men to bring foorth the fruits of hatred: and in ſtead of louing their neighbours as themſelues, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to hate them as their mortall enemies.</p>
                     <p>Infinit it were to ſtand vpon particulars, but by this which hath been ſaid it is apparant, that the furious flame of anger doth conſume in vs all the vertues and ſanctifying graces of Gods ſpirit, wherein principally the image of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie, as it defaceth in vs the image of God,<note place="margin">§.

                        </note> it maketh vs ſubiect to Gods anger: for as wee forgiue others, ſo doth God forgiue vs, Matth. 6.14.15.

But if either of them bee ſo ſtiffe and contentious that hee will not be reconciled, what doth he elſe but by refuſing the Lords arbitrement and determination make God his enemie?</p>

For when their anger and the fruites thereof, clamorous brauling and fighting, are vſuall and common aſwell for trifles as waightie matters, men deſperatelie contemne both, when they haue no hope to preuent either. They therefore who deſire that theſe bitter drugs of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhould haue any effectuall operation in the minds of inferiours,<note place="margin">Correction to be vſed like Phyſicke.</note> for the purging away of their faults and vices, muſt vſe them like Phyſicke, which if it be ordinarie will worke no extraordinarie effect, becauſe it groweth familiar with our natures, and therefore not fit to worke vpon them: <hi>nam medentur contraria.</hi> And hence it is that Phyſicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth vnprofitable to thoſe men in the time of grieuous ſickneſſe, which vpon euery trifling occaſion haue vſed it in the time of health, and made it as it were ſauce to diſgeſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10736:152"/>their meate: ſo if we would haue the phyſicke of the mind, correction and chaſtiſement, to worke deſired effect, they muſt be vſed ſparingly, and not for euery ſlip and infirmitie, which oftentimes in wiſedome ſhould bee diſſembled as though it were not perceiued,<note place="margin">The vanitie of ordinarie ſcolding and brawling.</note> and often pardoned in hope of amendment. Otherwiſe, if euerie toy and ſmall ouerſight prouoke anger, and anger incite to ſcolding and fighting, not onely the parties corrected are not bettered, but rather made more obſtinate and obdurate in their vices (for their hearts like anuils become harder with often beating) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he that correcteth, doth disfurniſh himſelfe of all fit reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to cure more deſperate diſeaſes. For if he vſe bitter chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ſeuere fighting for the cure of euerie trifling fault, what remedie doth he reſerue for correcting and reforming haynous offences? ſurely none. Wherby it commeth to paſſe, that inferiors will not bee reſtrained from committing all faults, but rather will bee as eaſilie induced to commit the greateſt as the leaſt, becauſe there is no great difference in the puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>But he who is wiſe and diſcreet will paſſe ouer many ſmall faults as though he perceiued them not,<note place="margin">Diſcretion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Senec. de ira lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>23.</hi>
                        </note> both becauſe (as one ſaith) <hi>Graetiſſimum est genus veniae neſcire quid quiſque peccauit:</hi> It is the moſt acceptable kinde of pardon to ſeeme ignorant of the fault; as alſo leſt taking notice of euerie little ſlippe, he make the offender ſhameleſſe and impudent in defending that as well done, which hee cannot excuſe as not done. Whereas ſo long as he thinketh his fault vnknowne hee will be ſo fearefull of committing the like, that he will bee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in hiding that which he hath alreadie committed. But if hee perceiue that the offender taketh occaſion by his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to offend often in the like kinde, then is hee to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the fault by vſing milde admonition; if that will not preuaile, then more ſharpe reprehenſion; but yet in priuate, for many witneſſes of the fault maketh him leſſe aſhamed to commit the like; wheras feare of open diſgrace will reſtraine him from it, ſo long as he is not alreadie diſgraced. But if the offender impudently and obſtinately perſiſt in his vice, or that the fault at the firſt be more notorious, then is he to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10736:153"/>to chaſtiſement and correction as the Surgion to the mortifying of a member, when the ſore is paſt all other cure. In doing whereof he is to auoide all furious anger, and to vſe ſoberneſſe and diſcretion, ioyning with his chaſtiſement wholeſome admonitions, conuincing the conſcience of the offender, by laying open the hainouſneſſe of his fault out of the word of God; or elſe by ſhewing him how hee hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt the law of nature or ciuill honeſtie. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will appeare to the offender, that his puniſhment pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the hatred of his ſinne, and not of his perſon; and ſo it wil cauſe him alſo more to hate his fault, then either his ſuperior that correcteth him for it, or then the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe which is deſeruedly inflicted.</p>
                     <p>If ſuperiors would vſe this milde and ſober diſcretion,<note place="margin">The profit that followeth well gouerned diſcretion.</note> ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie it would better containe inferiors in obedience, then fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious anger. For whence is it that one mans looke is more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded then anothers words? one mans milde admonition, then anothers bitter reprehenſion? one mans diſcreet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe, then anothers continuall brawling and fighting? ſurely from milde and well gouerned diſcretion which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in inferiors an awfull loue and ſonne-like feare, which more ſtrongly containeth them in obedience, and more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly reſtraineth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from committing any fault repugnant thereunto, then furious anger and rage, or the fruits thereof, continuall chiding and fighting. For continuall anger and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere puniſhment for euerie ſmall fault, without admitting any excuſe, doth not make inferiors ſorie becauſe they haue offended, but carefull and cunning in hiding and diſſembling their faults, or ſhameleſſe and impudent, either in denying or defending them.</p>
                     <p>Againe, as many ſtripes doe harden the skinne to indure them; ſo doe they harden the heart to contemne them; and they which vſe much chiding, doe moue their inferiors to imagine that it is their naturall communication and not any reprehenſion. If lightening and thunder were as common as the ſunne ſhine, though they bee terrible in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet who would regard them being ſo vſuall? and how much leſſe then the impotent brawling of an angrie man?
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10736:153"/>They therefore who would haue their anger feared and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, muſt let it like the thunder happen ſeldome, or elſe it will not be regarded like the thunder. When the Fox firſt ſaw the Lion, he trembled and quaked for feare, not daring to come neere him; when he ſaw him the ſecond time he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched ſomewhat neerer, but when he ſaw him daylie, hee feared not almoſt to come within the reach of his paw: So if thou but ſeldome ſhew thy ſelfe like a Lion, thou wilt bee feared and reſpected; whereas if continually thou appeare in this ſhape, euen thy moſt baſe vnderlings will not regard thee.

For it maketh the haire to ſtand an end, ſhewing the obdurate inflexibleneſſe of the mind: The eyes to ſtare and candle, as though with the Cockatrice they would kill with their lookes: The teeth to gnaſh like a furious Bore: The face now red, and ſoone after pale, as if either it bluſhed for ſhame of the minds follie, or enuied others good: The tongue to ſtammer, as being not able to expreſſe the rage of the heart: The blood ready to burſt out of the veines, as though it were affraid to ſtay in ſo furious a body: The breſt to ſwell, as being not large enough to containe their anger, and therfore ſeeketh to eaſe it ſelfe, by ſending out hot-breathing ſighes: The hands to beat the tables &amp; walles, which neuer offended them: The ioyntes to tremble and ſhake, as if they were affraide of the mindes furie: The feete to ſtampe the guiltleſſe earth, as though there were not room enough for it in the whole element of the aire; and therfore ſought entrance into the earth alſo. So that anger deformeth the body, from the haire of the head to the ſole of the foote. How vglie therfore is anger it ſelfe, when the effects therof
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10736:154"/>are thus monſtrous in ſo beautiful a ſubiect? How monſtrouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doth it deforme the mind, when the ſignes therof be thus horrible in the bodie?</p>
                     <p>But as it deformeth the body,<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>6. 2.</hi> Jt expoſeth it to dangers.</note> ſo it expoſeth it to infinite dangers by prouoking men to enter into priuate frayes and needleſſe quarrels, with ſuch deſperate reſolution, that they wholly neglect themſelues that they may hurt their enemie. Like to the Waſpe or Bee, which venture their owne liues, that they may but ſting thoſe that anger the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; ſo they, that they may ſatisfie their fury by reuenging a ſmall iniurie are ready to receiue a greater, for they care not to defend themſelues ſo they may offend their enemy: nay they are deſirous to giue wounds, though it bee thorow their owne bodies. And hence it is that ſome painting anger haue put in either hand a ſword, as being fit to hurt another, but not to defend himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>But what ſhould I ſpeake of receiuing hurt by outward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, ſeeing the angry man when he hath no other foes to hurt him, doth with his owne hands offer violence vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felſe? as is euident in their example who in their rage will not ſticke to pull off the haire of their owne heads &amp; beards, and to offer many other furious outrages againſt their owne perſons. So that the wiſe <hi>Salomon</hi> might well ſay, <hi>That a man of much anger ſhall ſuffer puniſhment:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Prou. 19.19.</note> for if no man elſe will, he will puniſh himſelfe. And ſo much for the body.</p>
                     <p>But anger bringeth no leſſe euils to the ſoule.<note place="margin">§. Sect. <hi>7.</hi> The euils which anger bringeth to the ſoule. <hi>1.</hi> It blindeth reaſon.</note> Firſt like a darke cloud it ouerſhadoweth and blindeth the light of reaſon, and for the time maketh men as though they were diſtraught of their wits. Wherof it is that anger is called <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis furor,</hi> a ſhort madneſſe; becauſe it differs not from mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but in time. Sauing that herein it is farre worſe, in that he who is poſſeſſed with madneſſe, is neceſſarilie, will he, nill he, ſubiect to that furie: but this paſſion is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wittingly and willingly. Madneſſe is the euill of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but anger the euill of ſinne alſo: madneſſe as it were thruſts reaſon from it imperiall throne; but anger abuſeth reaſon by forcing it with all violence to bee a ſlaue to paſſion.</p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10736:154"/>
                     <p>And in this reſpect it may fitly bee compared vnto a cruell tyrant, who hauing inuaded the gouernment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, doth ouerthrow counſell, law, and order, and ouerruleth all by force and furie: ſo anger hauing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſoueraigntie ouer the mind, taketh away all iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, counſell, and reaſon, and ouerſwayeth all by fooliſh affection and raging paſſion.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.11.</note> And therefore <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith well, that <hi>anger reſteth in the boſome of fooles;</hi> for either fooles it findeth them, or fooles it maketh them. The reaſon is apparant, becauſe anger maketh men raſh and vnaduiſed in their deliberations, and ſo their counſels and deſignes prooue imperfect and without life, like abortiue birthes which are borne before their time.</p>
                     <p>Examples hereof we haue in <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui,</hi>

                     <p>You ſee then that anger peruerteth iudgement, ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth counſell, and putteth out the eyes of reaſon, making it the ſlaue of paſſion, fit to execute thoſe workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in which rage imployeth it. Like vnto the Philiſtines,<note place="margin">Iudg. 16.21.</note> who hauing put out the eyes of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> made him to grinde in their mill, and to doe their drudgerie: So this raging paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hauing put out the eyes of reaſon, makes it a fit inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his owne buſineſſe, that is, in plotting and deuiſing that reuenge which is pleaſing and acceptable vnto it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it euidently appeareth, that furious anger is a notable meanes which Satan vſeth to worke our deſtruction. For when once by rage hee hath blinded the eye of reaſon, hee can eaſilie leade vs into a gulfe of all wickedneſſe. In reſpect whereof, Satan is compared to a cation Crowe, which intending to make the carcaſe of ſome ſillie Lambe his greedie pray, doth firſt picke out the eies, that it may
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10736:155"/>not bee able by flight to preuent a further miſchiefe: ſo hee indeuouring to make a pray of our bodies and ſoules, doth firſt ſeeke to blind reaſon, which is the eye of the ſoule, with the furie of paſſion, that ſo not hauing iudgement to diſcerne his ſleights, nor wiſedome to auoide them, he may the more eaſilie lead vs into the pit of perdition. Or hee may bee likened to a cunning fiſher-man, who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth the water that the fiſh may not deſcrie his net: ſo Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan blindeth our reaſon with this turbulent affection, that wee ſhould not diſcerne the ſinnes which like nets hee hath laid to intangle vs, before wee bee fallen into them. For anger caſting a miſt of perturbation before the ſight of reaſon, maketh men vnable to iudge of good or euill, right or wrong; and whereas reaſon in it owne nature iudgeth that which is right, anger maketh that ſeeme right which it iudgeth.</p>
                     <p>If therefore wee auoide thoſe things moſt carefully which hurt the eyes; or if they bee hurt, vſe ſuch medicines as are fit to cure them, becauſe the eye is the light and guide of the whole bodie: with how much more attentiue care ought wee auoide anger that blindeth reaſon, ſeeing it is the light and guide of the ſoule? which onelie eye of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane direction being put out, like <hi>Polyphemus</hi> wee wander in the deſarts of ſinne and wickedneſſe. If men abhorre drunkenneſſe (and that worthilie) becauſe it maketh them differ from brute beaſts onely in ſhape of the bodie; why ſhould they not for the ſame cauſe hate this vice of anger, which like a burning ague doth ſo diſtemper &amp; diſturbe the mind, that while y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fit laſteth, it vttereth nothing but rauing?</p>

As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee would account him a madde man, who with his owne hands ſhould ſet his houſe on fire and conſume it: ſo alike mad is hee to bee thought, who will ſet his ſoule on fire with the raging flames of anger, wherein it is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented in this life, but alſo (without repentance)
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10736:155"/>in the life to come it ſhall bee tormented euerlaſtingly; becauſe vniuſt anger is murther in Gods ſight, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.12.</note> Matth. 5.22: and murtherers ſhall not inherite the kingdome of God, but haue their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death: Reuel. 21.8.<note place="margin">Reuel. 21.8.</note>
                     </p>

Vniuſt anger is the cauſe of all tumults and vprores, ſeditions and conſpiracies, maſſacres and bloodie wars, yea the ouerthrow and confuſion of all cities and common-wealths. It is the cauſe which inciteth the Magiſtrate againſt the ſubiect, and the ſubiect againſt the Magiſtrate, the Prince againſt the people, and the people againſt the Prince, kingdome againſt kingdome, and nation againſt nation: and that not onely vpon waightie cauſes, but alſo vpon trifling occaſions. For as to make a furious and vnquenchable flame, it is not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall how ſmall the fire is that kindleth it, ſo the matter bee apt to receiue it wherein it is kindled, for one coale is enough to burne a whole citie, if it fall among flaxe, and one ſparke if it light in tinder or gunpowder: ſo it mattereth
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10736:156"/>not how ſmall the cauſe is which inflameth anger, for if the minde which receiueth it be ſubiect to be inflamed, it is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to ſet on fire and conſume whole Kingdomes and Common wealths, eſpecially if power be correſpondent to the violence of the affection.</p>

                     <p>THe remedies againſt anger are of two ſorts: firſt,<note place="margin">Sect. <hi>1.</hi>
                        </note> thoſe which cure anger in our ſelues; ſecondly, thoſe which cure it in others; and they both are of two kindes: firſt, ſuch as preuent anger and preſerue vs from falling into it: ſecondly, ſuch as free vs from it after it hath taken place. For anger is a diſeaſe of the minde: as therefore wiſe Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions thinke it the better &amp; ſafer courſe to preſerue health and preuent ſickneſſe, then to remoue the diſeaſe after it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10736:157"/>hath taken poſſeſsion of the body;<note place="margin">We muſt firſt ſeek to preuent anger. <hi>Sen. epi.</hi> 119</note> ſo the beſt courſe in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring ſpirituall Phiſick, is to preſerue the ſoule from vice, rather then to purge it away after it hath infected it; for <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia facilius repelluntur, quam expelluntur,</hi> Vices are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily kept from entrance, then thruſt out after they are entred: for as the common prouerbe is, there are but twelue points in the law, and poſſeſsion is as good as eleauen of them. If therefore anger haue gotten poſſeſsion, we ſhall hardly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſe it: It is our ſoules mortall enimie; as therefore we firſt ſeeke to keepe the enimie from entring the frontires of our country, but if hee be entred, as ſoone as we can to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him, ſo we muſt firſt endeauour to repel anger by ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the paſſages of our harts, that it may haue no entrance, but if it haue taken place, quickly to expell and remoue it. For if we ſuffer it to fortifie it ſelfe, it will grow ſo ſtrong and violent, that we ſhall be vnable to diſlodge it. And as in a ſiege of a Cittie the Citizens prouide all things neceſſary for their defence before the aſſault, that the enimie when he approcheth the wals, may not take them vnprouided; ſo if we will repell anger when it commeth, wee are to fortifie and arme our ſelues againſt it before it comes: for if it take vs vnprouided, it will eaſily make entrance, and more eaſily ouercome vs.</p>
                     <p>Let vs therfore firſt of all endeuour to vſe all good means by which we may preuent anger: for if it haue once gotten hold of vs, it will eaſily plunge vs headlong into violence and fury, whereas we may with greater facillity preuent the danger before we fall into it. For as experience teacheth vs, a man may eaſily contayne himſelfe from running downe the hill, while hee is on the toppe, but after he is entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a full race, hee cannot ſtay himſelfe before he commeth to the bottome: ſo it is more eaſie for any to abſtaine from running into anger, then to containe himſelfe when he is in the race, from falling into the bottome of fury.</p>
                     <p>Let vs then ſee the meanes how to preuent anger:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 2 The meanes to preuent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt anger.</note> the firſt remedy is by taking away the cauſes therof, for <hi>ſublatâ

                     <p>The firſt cauſe of anger, is ſelfe loue: if therefore wee would not fall into anger, we muſt labour to banniſh ſelfe loue, and to follow the rule of charitie; <hi>Loue our neighbours as our ſelues, and doe nothing vnto them, which wee would not haue them do vnto vs.</hi> Before therefore we let the reines loofe vnto our anger, let vs ſet our ſelues in the place of him with whom we are angry, and conſider how we would deſire to be vſed if we had ſo offended, and in like manner are we to behaue our ſelues towards him. So ſhall we not aggrauate thoſe iniuries which are offered vs, and extenuate thoſe which we offer others, ſo ſhall we not haue our iudgement ouer-ballanced with an vnequall affection, ſo ſhall wee not bee incenſed for ſuffering that, which wee haue often offered.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond cauſe of anger is pride and hautineſſe of ſpirit: if therefore we would not fall into anger,<note place="margin">

If therefore, we would be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from anger, we muſt often thinke of this contagious le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of originall ſinne, which hath ſo generally infected all the ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> that there remaineth nothing in vs but pollution and filthines. And then as one infected with the plague, is not offended with him that is ſubiect to the ſame infection: As the Lazar doth neyther with ſcorne nor choller, but rather with pittie and compaſsion behold the ſores of his fellow: ſo the plague and ſore of ſinne which wee ſee in another, will not make vs angry with the party vvhich is infected and viſited, but rather in commiſeration and pittie to vſe all good meanes vvherby he may be cured, if vve conſider that this plague and ſore of ſinne is ſo vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall that it hath infected all mankinde.</p>

If he that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a ſeruant, vvould thinke with himſelfe, that he hireth one vvho is not free from faults, if he that choſeth a friend vvould then conſider that he hath his wants and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: If he that marryeth a vvife vvould remember that he marryeth a woman, and therefore one ſubiect to infirmities: neither the ſmall faults of his ſeruants, nor imperfections of his friends, nor infirmities of his vvife vvould eaſily prouoke him to choller and fury, ſeeing he did not come ſhort of his reckoning.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer vve are to meditate vpon our owne peculiar infirmities and vvants, and before wee are angry with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to enter into our ſelues,<note place="margin">Plutarch de cohib. irac.</note> and to ſay vvith <hi>Plato: Nuncubi &amp; ego talis?</hi> haue not I alſo offended in this or in that which

                        </note> whereby we may preuent and repell anger, before we fall into it. Now in the next place I will ſet downe, how we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues after that anger hath made an entrance, and taken place in vs. And this the Apoſtle teacheth vs in the reſtraint: <hi>Let not the Sunne goe downe on your wrath.</hi> That is, if through infirmitie ye fall into vniuſt anger, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue not in it, but rather abandon this corrupt affection with all poſsible ſpeede. So that our anger muſt not ſleepe with vs, and after we awake, awake alſo; wee muſt not vſe it like our garments, lay it aſide ouernight, with a purpoſe to take it againe the next day: but rather wee are to put it off like the old man, with full reſolution neuer againe to entertaine or aſſume it, or like ſome polluted ragges which are not vvorth the vvearing. And this muſt wee doe not once or twiſe, but if euery day vvith the Sunne anger ariſe in our harts, vvee are euery day to diſlodge and expell it, before the Sunne going downe. And as the night doth coole the heat which in the day time the Sunne hath made, ſo muſt it alſo quench the flames of anger kindled in our harts. And not without great reaſon hee requireth that before night commeth we abandon anger,<note place="margin">The danger of anger retained.</note> for otherwiſe wee ſhall giue place to the diuels tentations, as hee intimateth in the words following: for hauing exhorted vs not to let the Sun goe downe on our wrath, he preſently addeth, <hi>neither giue place to the Diuell.</hi> Noting thereby that they who doe not
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10736:163"/>onely entertaine anger in the day, but alſo lodge it in the night, doe thereby lay themſelues open to the fiery darts of Sathan.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8.</note> 
                        <hi>For he continually goeth about like a roaring Lyon, ſeeking whom he may deuoure.</hi> And vvhen he findeth ſuch as haue retained anger euen in their beds, thinking them a fit pray, he approcheth and vvith his bellowes of fury he more inflameth the fire of anger, till it blazeth out into furious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge: he aggrauateth the iniury receiued, telling them that if they put vp ſuch an indignity, they will expoſe themſelues to the like, or for ſuffering this, looſe all their credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, by incurring the note of cowardize. And ſo hauing wrought in their hearts a full reſolution to take reuenge, in the next place he putteth into their heads the moſt fit means and oportunitie of performing it with all rage and cruelty. And ſo often times it commeth to paſſe that when they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, they put that in practiſe, which they haue deuiſed lying vpon their pillow.</p>
                     <p>To preuent therefore ſo great an euill; if wee cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together repell anger, yet let vs ſoone expell it. For though at the firſt it be but a ſmall ſparke, yet if it be nouriſhed it will quickly increaſe to a furious flame. As therefore when a houſe is newly ſet on fire, men labour earneſtly, and with all ſpeed to quench it, before it haue taken hold of the main poſtes and great beames; otherwiſe it will be too late after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when it is increaſed to his full ſtrength: ſo when our hearts are firſt ſet on fire with anger, we are preſently to quench it with the water of the ſpirit, for after we are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enflamed, it vvill be too late to apply any remedie till the flame haue ſpent it ſelfe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Obiection.</note>But ſome will ſay, I fall into anger many times when I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer meane it, and it hath ouercome me before I am aware; how therefore ſhould I preuent that vvhich I doe not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, or free my ſelfe from it, ſeeing it violently ouer-ruleth me?</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin" type="runSum">Anſwere.</note>To the firſt I anſwere, that if we carefully vvatch ouer our ſelues, vve ſhall eaſily perceiue vvhen vve are inclining
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10736:163"/>to anger: for as there are many ſignes vvhich goe before a ſtorme, and many ſymptomes, vvhich diſcouer diſeaſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we fall into them: ſo wee may eaſily diſcerne in our ſelues many notes and ſignes, of this tempeſtuous ſtorme and raging feuer of the minde, Vniuſt Anger.</p>
                     <p>To the other I anſwere, that anger doth not preſently as ſoone as it is entered into the heart ouer-rule vs, before it be growne to greater ſtrength then it hath at the firſt, for as the greateſt fire hath but a ſmall beginning, and vvhen it is but begun, is eaſily quenched: ſo the moſt furious anger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not to his full ſtrength at the firſt entrance, but by little and little increaſeth like a flame, by taking hold of new matter. And therefore howſoeuer after it hath vvholy inflamed a man, it is moſt hardly quenched, yet in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof, it is eaſily ſuppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>But let vs ſee the meanes how vve may ſubdue anger after it hath giuen the aſſault.<note place="margin">

                     <p>The chiefe nouriſhment vvhereby anger is nouriſhed and increaſed, is multiplying of words,<note place="margin">Multiplying of words the chief food of anger.</note> for though the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury at the firſt be ſmall, yet if either it be aggrauated by him that ſuffereth it, or defended by him that offereth it, it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſeth men to great anger. Well therefore in this reſpect may words be ſaid to be but winde; for as nothing ſooner then winde cauſeth a ſmall ſparke to burſt out into a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous flame: ſo nothing ſooner doth cauſe a ſmall ſparke of anger increaſe to a raging flame of reuenge, then the vvinde of wordes. We are not therefore to imagine with ſome, that we can diſgorge our ſtomackes of anger by vomitting our ſpleene in bitter words; for they do not onely in their owne nature whet and ſharpen our owne affections, but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke the other, with vvhom we are offended to requite vs
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:10736:164"/>with the like, and ſo to adde new matter to the old flame. As well therefore may we think to quench the fire with wood, as anger with words, for as wood is the nouriſhment of the fire, ſo words are the nouriſhment of anger. Let vs rather in our anger imitate the wiſe <hi>Socrates,</hi>

                     <p>As therefore they who are vexed with the falling ſicknes, (if they cannot by their owne ordinary remedies preuent their fit) will go out of the company of others, that falling ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly, they may haue no vvitneſſe of their deformitie: ſo they who are not able to curbe in their anger, with the reyne of reaſon, were beſt to withdraw themſelues, and to keepe priuate, while their fit laſteth: that ſo they may hide the vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of their vice, which being ſeene doth often moue their aduerſaries to ſcorne and laughter, and their friends to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and pittie.

For if we reſiſt it in the firſt encounter, we ſhall finde the ſtrength thereof much weakened, and this the wiſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenodorus</hi> knew well; who being to depart from <hi>Auguſtus,</hi>
                        <pb n="75" facs="tcp:10736:164"/>was requeſted by him that hee would leaue behinde him ſome good inſtruction, for the well gouerning of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:<note place="margin">Plutarch in Apotheg.</note> to whom he gaue this counſaile, that he ſhould doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his anger, before hee had numbred on his fingers the letters of the Greeke Alphabet.

                        <note place="margin">Senec. de ira. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>15.</hi>
                        </note> who finding his anger incenſed againſt his ſeruant, deferred to take correction, ſaying: <hi>I would beat thee if I were not angry.</hi> And alſo in <hi>Plato,</hi> who being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to anger by ſome notable fault committed by his ſeruant, tooke a cudgell into his hands, and held it ouer him a good ſpace, as if he would haue ſtroken; And being aſked of his friend <hi>Speuſippus,</hi> vvhat hee meant by ſuch kinde of action.

That it is a foule ſhame, firſt to be angry, and then to iudge, firſt to take puniſhment, and then to examine the cauſe; that is to ſay, whether hath offended, he that taketh puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or he on whom it is inflicted: whereas in proceſſe of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10736:165"/>time the truth will appeare, whether reuenge may be more iuſtly taken or omitted.

As therefore if a man blow vpon a ſpark he maketh it increaſe to a flame, but if he ſpit vpon it hee quencheth it, and both proceede out of the mouth: ſo hee that vttereth croſſe anſweres, doth make the leaſt ſpark of anger become furious rage, whereas milde and ſoft anſweres doe eaſily appeaſe it.</p>

                           <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. The third meanes diſcreet admonition.</note> is after his anger is ouerpaſt to giue him wholeſome counſayle and good admonitions, whereby he may be taught the great euils which follow anger. For as it is not fit to miniſter Phiſicke to a ſicke patient, while hee is in a fit of an ague, and therefore diſcreet Phiſitions rather make choiſe of their patients good day: ſo it is in vaine for a man to ſeeke the curing of anger by good counſayle, vnles he ſtay till the fit be paſſed ouer, and the heat of anger ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what aſſwaged. For a man cannot; nor will not hearken to another mans reaſons, while he is ſubiect to his owne paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And as a man heareth nothing almoſt which is ſaid when his houſe is on fire, for the noyſe of the multitude, the crackling of the flame, and the perturbation of his owne minde: ſo the violence of this affection, and furie of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, doth make a man while he is in a fit of rage, deafe to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10736:167"/>all reaſon. And therefore they are to be admoniſhed when the fury hath ſomewhat ſpent it ſelfe, and the great euils of anger both in reſpect of their ſoules and bodies, their neighbours and friends, the Church and common wealth, are as it were in one view, to bee preſented to their more ſober meditations.</p>
                     <p>But they who admoniſh are to remember,<note place="margin">Mildneſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing an angry man.</note> that they vſe all mildeneſſe and diſcreation in their admonition, leaſt while they goe about to preuent anger for the time to come, they preſently prouoke it. For if they bee too auſtere and rough in vſing too inſolent inuectiues and bitter reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they doe not onely commit themſelues a great abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, while in reprouing anger they ſhew their own ſpleene, but alſo make their admonition altogether vnprofitable. Becauſe the angry man (if he ſee them ſo ſharp and ſeuere) will rather thinke how hee may defend his fault by aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating the iniuries which hee hath receiued, then eyther confeſſe it, to ſuch a ſynick cenſurer, or labour to amend it. For as no man will ſuffer his wound to be ſearched by ſuch a Surgeon as hath a rough hand, and a hard hart, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will any patient commit himſelfe to the cure of a fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and mercileſſe Phiſition: ſo no man can abide (and therefore much leſſe an angry man) to haue his gauled faults, too much rubbed, or the wounds and diſeaſes of his minde, healed and cured, with too ſharpe a corraſiue and lothſome potion of inſolent and bitter words. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who will angerly reproue anger, are no fit Phiſitions for them who are ſubiect to this paſsion. For to ſuch they will either hide and diſſemble their imperfections, rather fayning themſelues well, then they will diſcouer their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe to ſuch a crabbed Phiſition; or elſe they will iuſtifie, and defend them as lawfull and neceſſarie. And as the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Snake, when hee hath no meanes to flye away, will turne againe, and deſperately leape into the face of him that purſueth him: or as the timerous Stagge, when hee can eſcape no longer by running, maketh a ſtand, turning
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10736:167"/>cowardly feare into deſperate rage. So the angry man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo hardly purſued with ſharpe inuectiues and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that he hath no euaſion of excuſe to couer his fault, nor hope of pittie by confeſsing it, doth as it were flye into the face of the reprouer, by obiecting his greater faults, that they may ſerue to extenuate his which are leſſe. You (will hee ſay) who ſo ſharpely reproue me for my choller, haue other faults as great as this, and therefore you may doe well to cure your ſelfe before you become anothers Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Yea in this you would ſhew you ſelfe no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, if you had the like occaſion to ſhew your anger. And howſoeuer you ſeeme in your conuerſation ſweet and harmeleſſe, yet hee that ſhould taſt you would not finde you free from gaule, hee that ſhould handle you ſomewhat roughly, would ſoone perceiue by his owne ſmart that you haue a ſting, though you doe not thurſt it out being not prouoked. In a word, the angry man will neuer cry <hi>pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui,</hi> vnleſſe afterwards with ſome confidence hee may adde <hi>miſerere</hi> neyther will hee ſuffer his wounds to be cured by ſuch an one, who by his rough handling will more vexe him, then pleaſure him by the cure.</p>
